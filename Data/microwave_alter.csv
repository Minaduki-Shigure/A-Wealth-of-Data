Apparently, a faulty magnetron is a wide spread occurrence. I did a live chat with an online rep. She wanted to send me to a service tech over an hour away. I declined. I explained to her similar issues from most owners of this model and stated this should be looked at as being recalled. No way we all messed up our units. I forwarded her to the Amazon reviews.

Then a couple of weeks ago I came into the kitchen and saw the SE error code. I wasn't able to set the clock so I unplugged it and started researching what the error code meant. As you have probably read in other reviews, this is a common Samsung problem. The steam from cooking on the stove underneath the microwave damages the cooking sensor which causes the entire oven to malfunction. And please understand that I haven't used my stove top for cooking on a regular basis!<br /><br />After a couple of hours, I plugged it in to see what happened and was able to set the clock and use it. I was thrilled but cautious. Which was good because within 10 minutes I heard the microwave beep and start cooking. I shut it off and watched it and within 15 seconds, I saw &#34;Baked Potato&#34; on the screen and it started up again. So now it's unplugged and will be replaced.<br /><br />Samsung says it's out of the warranty period but will send a technician to fix it for more than it will cost me to purchase a new unit. I did get five years out of it so I'm chalking it up to lessons learned - no more Samsung microwaves. When they have this many ovens with the same problem, you would think the company would make things write. To be fair, I have always owned Samsung televisions and been very happy with them.

I'm talking about the 220v Advantium oven.  My experience:<br />I had the house rewired to put this 220v oven above the stove.<br />  The first one I owned lasted about 1 1/2 years, then the bottom heating element (a halogen bulb) burnt out.  I had service replace it.  About 1/2 a year later the controller for the microwave burnt out.  When it worked, it worked great. So, I replaced the whole unit.<br />  The second one was exactly the same design: 220v with halogen bulb lower heating element.  After about 2 years, the halogen bulb again burnt out.  Again after another year, the whole unit broke to the point I again replaced it.<br />  So, I really liked the concept, but obviously the design engineering was bad.  This was severely pointed out in the 3rd 220v unit I bought:  They changed the design!  They replaced the lower halogen heating element with an infrared heating element.  Halogen bulbs are near instant on.  Infrared takes time to heat up.  So, frozen 12&#34; pizza took a bit longer to cook, and all the recipes that relied on bottom heat was off a bit... seemed like they changed the heater characteristics without bothering to reprogram the recipes, but Ok.  I still liked the concept.<br />  Then, the lower now infrared heater failed.  So I called service. They replaced the part.  But now... it wouldn't  even cook a pizza.  Too little power from the lower heating unit.  Service came out to fix it again.  Then, I cooked a pizza in front of the technician that replaced the bulb. The &#34;cooked&#34; pizza came out burnt on the top, and the bottom uncooked: &#34;floppy slices&#34;.  The product after repair, no longer performed it's function.  I had many calls into GE consumer relations.  No help.  At the end, I was told the fixed product worked as designed, and there was nothing more they would do on this unit.  They were willing to sell me a 4th one.  When I asked how it would cook, he didn't know.<br /><br />Love the concept, but bad execution, and expensive and poor support.",6/15/2015,0.0991455614566803,"['Stay', 'away', 'Bad', 'product', 'Expensive', 'repairs', 'Poor', 'br', 'br', 'owned', 'white', 'stainless', 'talked', 'friend', 'buying', 'stainless', 'one', 'bad', 'move', 'underpowered', 'love', 'concept', 'point', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'stay', 'away', 'product', 'talking', 'Advantium', 'oven', 'experience', 'br', 'house', 'rewired', 'put', 'oven', 'br', 'first', 'one', 'owned', 'lasted', 'years', 'bottom', 'heating', 'element', 'halogen', 'bulb', 'burnt', 'service', 'replace', 'year', 'later', 'controller', 'microwave', 'burnt', 'worked', 'worked', 'great', 'replaced', 'whole', 'br', 'second', 'one', 'exactly', 'design', 'halogen', 'bulb', 'lower', 'heating', 'element', 'years', 'halogen', 'bulb', 'burnt', 'another', 'year', 'whole', 'unit', 'broke', 'point', 'replaced', 'br', 'really', 'liked', 'concept', 'obviously', 'design', 'engineering', 'bad', 'severely', 'pointed', 'unit', 'bought', 'changed', 'design', 'replaced', 'lower', 'halogen', 'heating', 'element', 'infrared', 'heating', 'element', 'Halogen', 'bulbs', 'near', 'instant', 'Infrared', 'takes', 'time', 'heat', 'frozen', 'pizza', 'took', 'bit', 'longer', 'cook', 'recipes', 'relied', 'bottom', 'heat', 'bit', 'seemed', 'like', 'changed', 'heater', 'characteristics', 'without', 'bothering', 'reprogram', 'recipes', 'Ok', 'still', 'liked', 'br', 'lower', 'infrared', 'heater', 'failed', 'called', 'service', 'replaced', 'part', 'would', 'even', 'cook', 'pizza', 'little', 'power', 'lower', 'heating', 'unit', 'Service', 'came', 'fix', 'cooked', 'pizza', 'front', 'technician', 'replaced', 'bulb', 'cooked', 'pizza', 'came', 'burnt', 'top', 'bottom', 'uncooked', 'floppy', 'slices', 'product', 'repair', 'longer', 'performed', 'function', 'many', 'calls', 'GE', 'consumer', 'relations', 'help', 'end', 'told', 'fixed', 'product', 'worked', 'designed', 'nothing', 'would', 'unit', 'willing', 'sell', 'one', 'asked', 'would', 'cook', 'br', 'br', 'Love', 'concept', 'bad', 'execution', 'expensive', 'poor', 'support']"

The older model worked fine until I melted it with a small kitchen fire (naturally the one time I disconnected the smoke alarm).  The new model arrived quickly.  I got a friend to help install it.  You'll need a friend  -It's too heavy for you to hold it up with one hand while you screw the bolt on with the other.<br /><br />I gave it four stars in my initial review but I'm changing it to one star because after only a couple of months, the microwave's fan and interior lights would go on sometimes when I closed the oven door.  But if I opened and gently closed the door again, it'd turn off.  It's been about six months since I first installed this oven and this problem is becoming frequent.  Today, my son texts me from home that the microwave won't turn off no matter what he does so I told him to leave the door open and when I get home tonight, I will disconnect it so it doesn't burn the house down.  A microwave oven is supposed to make our lives more convenient,  not fill us with dread that it can start an electric fire.  Checking on the internet, it seems that this is not an uncommon problem.

The convection circulating fan had failed, and there was no time to have it repaired.  The fan motor simply needed to be replaced.  The microwave function still worked perfectly, but I needed the convection oven for holiday baking.  It was just before Thanksgiving and I couldn't find a replacement of the the Sharp locally, and no time for an on-line order.<br /><br />I found this Samsung locally, and it looked like it would fill the bill.  It did save me from holiday disaster, but I've been far from pleased with it.  You have to memorize ridiculous sequences of the controls that offer you only numbers as feedback so the manual near at hand is essential.  It will only accept two entries for sequence cooking; I used three much of the time in the Sharp for extraordinary results cooking rice and polenta.  Now I have to enter the first two stages, then the third after the first two are finished.<br /><br />The temperature of the convection mode is incredibly erratic; I set 200 degrees and when I checked the oven temperature during cooking it was at 350.  Today I set it at 400 (the maximum) and it never got above 350.  I think the control circuit board is failing because I looked at the clock when it was 6:12 and the oven clock read 10:something.  I reset the clock, then looked at it this evening at around 8:30 and it read 1:something.<br /><br />The only good thing about the appliance is that the beeper can be shut off.  (I hate those electronic beeps.)  As far as I'm concerned Samsung should stick to making phones and not try to produce products they don't have enough concern about to do well.

It's already been getting a lot of use, and is holding up great so far. Of course, I know it hasn't been used that long, so I'll be sure to update my review as they use it more.<br /><br />The nicest features of this are:<br /><br />* It's a microwave that also grills and crisps food -- so it really functions more like an oven than a microwave.  It comes with a grill rack, and you can cook meat on it.  When you use the grill function, you can put metal into the microwave . . . but just be careful that you take out the metal once you use it as a microwave proper. The gill function works fine, but doesn't make your food quite as crispy and nice as a regular toaster oven does.<br /><br />*  The crispy plate is also perfect for doing pizzas, and the students who have been using it to cook frozen pizzas have said that they are evenly cooked.<br /><br />* The 1,000 watts make this pretty powerful.  It's good at evenly cooking food, and doesn't leave those cold places in frozen dinners like cheaper microwaves do.<br /><br />*  There are ten power levels and a plus 30 seconds button, so you can easily add more time to your cooking time.<br /><br />* A standard variety of pre-set buttons make this good for doing basics such as popcorn, veggies, and potatoes.<br /><br />* The exterior has a scratch-resistant coating, and the stainless steel facing doesn't pick up smudges and fingerprints like stainless steel often does.<br /><br />The measurements on the 1.1 cubic foot microwave are: 11-11/16 H by 20-3/8 W by 15-13/16 D in inches.<br /><br />Overall, this is a really nice microwave.

It's replaced my old 1000 watt sanyo. It has some features you don't find on many microwaves including a power saving mode (which turns off the LED clock), a grilling element on the top, and ceramic plate. In theory you could cook a pizza, heat up some bacon all while retaining the crispiness. I'd probably heat up frozen egg rolls before i do the any of the prior though. The grilling feature is gimmicky to me. First you lose height for reheating taller items. And I'm not one for having an issue using the oven for a frozen pizza or a pan for your bacon. Maybe even a toaster oven if you wanna reheat those chicken mcnuggets. There's also one more minor issue. The rotating glass plate is raised a bit too high around the edges than i'm used to.

The microwave stopped working altogether in June 2015. If you find this model anywhere online I advise you DO NOT BUY IT....<br /><br />Full disclosure - I usually make my purchases from Amazon but I had a coupon for 15% off any item at PC Richards (a local store) and was fooled into buying this when it was recommended to me by a salesman. I've owned it for just over 2 years now. Most problems started immediately. I will never buy another GE microwave for this reason, and I'm considering never buying any GE product - anything that takes electricity to run must be made much better for safety reasons, and this is one of the worse electronic appliances I've ever purchased.<br /><br />PROS: none that I know of. No wonder it's discontinued.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />&#62; Very soon after the warranty ended we started smelling burnt plastic whenever it was used for any length of time, at any power level. The smell lingers and gets into your food.<br /><br />&#62; When cooking anything, a baked potato for example, the moisture from the food gets trapped inside the oven an pours out when you open the door. The walls, floor, and ceiling of the microwave are dripping wet and must be dried after each use unless you want to end up with a muggy mungy moldy mess after a few weeks. And no, the vent is not blocked on the outside. On the inside, maybe, but that would be a defect the consumer cannot see or fix.<br /><br />&#62; Door open button is very flimsy.<br /><br />&#62; Light stays on when you close the door (when you're done) if you are not careful. You must make sure door closes completely - even if it looks closed it might not be and if the lights are on in the kitchen you might not notice the interior light of the microwave is still on - this can make it over heat (I came back hours later and the inside of the oven was very warm) and may blow out the bulb, which normally lasts the lifetime of the oven.<br /><br />&#62; Vents are on the left side, not the top or bottom. This means venting can be difficult if you have something sitting next to it on the left side. See my photo.<br /><br />&#62; All buttons are hard to push, which is not good for those with disability or arthritis.<br /><br />&#62; The clock timer (the one used when not cooking) is tricky to stop - you must read the manual to figure it out because you can't use common sense for this one; manual says you must press timer button and hold for at least 3 seconds to stop this timer.<br /><br />&#62; If you make a mistake when using the cooking timer you can easily add more time to cooking than you planned. For example, I pressed 14 minutes but wanted to change it to 12, so I tried to clear it and thought I did, but when the 12 minutes of cooking time was done it started again on its own for another 14 minutes. There was nothing to warn me this would happen and I could find nothing in the manual that explains it.<br /><br />&#62; No minute button, only 30 second increments.<br /><br />&#62; Turntable moves out of place very easily, like when you place an item on it or remove something from inside the microwave. The groves that hold it in place are shallow so this allows it to move out of place with just a small nudge. Very annoying.<br /><br />&#62; Emails to GE were never answered.62; Vents are on the left side, not the top or bottom.

My LG microwave suddenly stopped working and I am ashamed to say that the majority of my cooking is done in the microwave - TV dinners, oatmeal, popcorn etc. so I wanted to buy and take home my purchase immediately. After shopping at Home Depot, Lowes and Costco I found that none of these retailers kept over the range microwaves in stock. The same proved to be the situation at Best Buy except they had this Whirlpool microwave that had been returned because of shipping damage and was available for immediate sale and for $100.00 off its $249.99 regular price because of a large dent on the left rear that cannot be seen after installation. I had read reviews and intended to buy a Samsung unit but, I did not want to wait 3 days for delivery and for $150.00 I figured it was worth the risk. The installation went well, I found the instructions and templates provided good information on the installation procedure. I was able to install this microwave by myself. The LG unit I was replacing came with the home so I don't know how old it was (other than I bought my home 1-1/2 years ago) and it was considerable heavier than the Whirlpool unit. The door on the Whirlpool unit opens and closes better than the LG unit, it is extremely easy to operate and has been functioning flawlessly for the 2 weeks I've had it installed. I have never been a fan of Whirlpool dating back many years ago to a Whirlpool washing machine I had owned, bad memories last a long time. This purchase seems to be a winner for its appearance, ease of installation, its functionality and unbeatable price. If anything in this situation changes I will update this review, but as of today I could not be happier with the service it is providing me.",1/22/2015,0.06864455342292786,"['purchased', 'microwave', 'Best', 'Buy', 'reading', 'reviews', 'guess', 'Whirlpool', 'problem', 'way', 'units', 'packaged', 'LG', 'microwave', 'suddenly', 'stopped', 'working', 'ashamed', 'say', 'majority', 'cooking', 'done', 'microwave', 'TV', 'dinners', 'oatmeal', 'popcorn', 'etc', 'wanted', 'buy', 'take', 'home', 'purchase', 'immediately', 'shopping', 'Home', 'Depot', 'Lowes', 'Costco', 'found', 'none', 'retailers', 'kept', 'range', 'microwaves', 'stock', 'proved', 'situation', 'Best', 'Buy', 'except', 'Whirlpool', 'microwave', 'returned', 'shipping', 'damage', 'available', 'immediate', 'sale', 'regular', 'price', 'large', 'dent', 'left', 'rear', 'seen', 'installation', 'read', 'reviews', 'intended', 'buy', 'Samsung', 'unit', 'want', 'wait', 'days', 'delivery', 'figured', 'worth', 'risk', 'installation', 'went', 'well', 'found', 'instructions', 'templates', 'provided', 'good', 'information', 'installation', 'procedure', 'able', 'install', 'microwave', 'LG', 'unit', 'replacing', 'came', 'home', 'know', 'old', 'bought', 'home', 'years', 'ago', 'considerable', 'heavier', 'Whirlpool', 'unit', 'door', 'Whirlpool', 'unit', 'opens', 'closes', 'better', 'LG', 'unit', 'extremely', 'easy', 'operate', 'functioning', 'flawlessly', 'weeks', 'installed', 'never', 'fan', 'Whirlpool', 'dating', 'back', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'Whirlpool', 'washing', 'machine', 'owned', 'bad', 'memories', 'last', 'long', 'time', 'purchase', 'seems', 'winner', 'appearance', 'ease', 'installation', 'functionality', 'unbeatable', 'price', 'anything', 'situation', 'changes', 'update', 'review', 'today', 'could', 'happier', 'service', 'providing']"

On comparing against my Sharp unit I found this few pounds lighter. But the marked difference which was noticed is the noise level. While Sharp was really a rowdy teenager this guy is really a silent one. When measured with smartphone sound meter app, the operational level was about 65dB ( which is like normal conversational level). I payed $40 premium for the stainless steel model which was purely for aesthetic reason - my previous microwave was plastic and I did not have any 'material' issue. As for functions, besides the common controls like popcorn,pizza,beverage etc there were a few other controls which I find useful. There is a power level button which lets you step down from full power level to say 50% level. There is also a kitchen timer control which works independently of the cooking control - $5 timer will do that function but having it there help reduce kitchen clutter. There is a two step cooking, which essentially step down the power for the second round - yet to try this feature.<br />Instead of the push button door release a door handle would have made it look more industrial.

A lot of the reviews I have read here are either mistaken in their details or are trying to compare apples to oranges. Samsung (or whoever the Samsung dealer on here is) has only added to the confusion, unfortunately.<br /><br />First, a few points to set the record straight. The appliance is NOT covered in stainless steel. There may be a bit of it in the trim, but it seems like whoever wrote the description hasn't actually sen one in person. Most of the outside has a black, textured metal finish, which does seem to blend in quite nicely with my own black and stainless steel kitchen appliances. It may not blend in with a kitchen that is all stainless and has no black in it though.<br /><br />There is a bare minimum of plastic in the construction, which is limited to the trim, &#34;open button&#34; and part of the door latch. I have not had any problem keeping either the highly polished front door clean nor the outside of the appliance. In fact, the texture of the black sheet metal on most of its outside surface actually prevents it from becoming a fingerprint magnet.<br /><br />Another misconception comes from the grill rack that fits inside. Some people have mentioned that it is only to be used in the grill mode, which is not true. The rack can be used in the combination grill/microwave mode just fine and your microwave will NOT burst into flames. From the manual, page 11: &#34;Grill Rack, to be placed on the turntable. The metal rack can be used in grill and combination cooking&#34;. It will even &#34;work&#34; in the microwave-only setting, although it won't contribute to the cooking process at all. In fact, the main feature of this appliance is the ability to both microwave AND grill at the same time, and you can't utilize the grill to any effect without the rack in place.<br /><br />This brings me to the main point of my review. Those who are most critical of this appliance are simply comparing it to a microwave. This is an apples vs oranges type of logic as the addition of the grilling element really makes this an unfair comparison. Is it heavier than most stand-alone microwaves? Of course it is, because it has an entirely separate heating element, electronics and carries the additional weight of a ceramic enamel interior. This is really two appliances in one that work together seamlessly to greatly enhance the texture and heat distribution of foods such as pasta, pizza, crusts, etc. The additional heating element also makes the appliance larger than stand-alone microwaves, which is entirely understandable to me. This also explains the slightly lower wattage rating than some heavy-duty microwaves. If used with the grill though, it seems to cook items just as fast as a microwave with a higher wattage rating.<br /><br />Adding to the weight is a metal exterior that uses a heavier gauge of sheet metal than the vast majority of stand-alone microwaves on the market. The reason for this is pretty simple. To keep people from burning themselves when coming into contact with the appliance. Without the heavy-duty (which is necessarily heavy) inside and outside finishes the device has, it would eventually lead to someone getting accidentally burned. For those who wonder why it doesn't have more capacity or more wattage, the reasons all boil down to safety. You can only add so much shielding to keep the size (and cost) of such an appliance practical. I think that Samsung engineers did a pretty good job at balancing safety, size and materials to keep this at a reasonable cost for a device that offers so much more than a simple microwave does.<br /><br />In regards to cost, I have seen the price of this product fluctuate wildly over the past few weeks. At one point I believe it was $179 (shipping included). Then it went up to $230 (shipping NOT included). Today, it is down to $199.99 with free shipping. I have no idea what the MSRP of the unit actually is, but for the quality of construction it has and the features it carries, it seems like at bargain to me.<br /><br />For me personally, this product is just the right size for the foods I cook and offers a lot of flexibility as to how I can cook things. The polished surface makes it by far the nicest looking appliance in my kitchen, ever. It reminds me a lot of my Samsung Galaxy S4 cellphone, actually. All in all, I couldn't be happier with my purchase and I would recommend it to anyone. If you have no interest in the grilling feature you probably wouldn't want to buy this though, because it is definitely more expensive than a stand-alone microwave. If you are only going to use it for microwaving it is overkill. I'd never go back to a regular microwave after having used this though. I am too spoiled with this product's cooking ability at this point. In any event, I think that it deserves more praise than it seems to be getting here. Try it for yourself and I would bet that you won't be disappointed.n to $199.99 with free shipping.

510,19812610,R3ROW1FM562STG,B00NN136NQ,464779766,"samsung mc11h6033ct countertop convection microwave with 1.1 cu. ft. capacity, slim fry technology, grilling element, ceramic enamel interior, drop down door, and eco mode in stainless steel",4,5,5,Y,N,A Multi-Function Unit that is surprisingly good but not perfect! (The preheat setting is problematic to say the least),"I picked this unit up primarily for the Convection Oven function but have come to really appreciate its versatility. That said, the unit is not without issues.<br /><br />The short story is: the microwave function works perfectly and is perhaps a bit more powerful than my built in unit. The grill function is great - provided you use the pan that comes with the unit. The convection function is wonderful but never and I mean never use parchment paper in the unit. (FIRE!) The preheat function is problematic and 7 time out of 10 will cause your unit to stop working for at least 15 minute after it shuts off, especially if you interrupt it when it is the 10 minute post preheat time frame to try to use the convection oven setting. The unit is very sharp looking and feels solidly built. The two racks and accompanying pan are also reasonably well made.<br /><br />Now for those who are interested, the long story:<br /><br />Microwave:<br /><br />Works just great, seemed to have more power than my built in unit so I did a boil water test and found it got the water percolating about 30 seconds faster than my primary unit. The kids and I have learned to dial the time back when we use this unit.<br /><br />Grill:<br /><br />Love this feature, I made the following - Grilled Cheese (upper rack and pan - 7 minutes with flip at half way point) turned out beautifully. Open face bagel with cheese (upper rack and pan - 5 minutes) grilled to perfection.<br /><br />Convection Oven:<br /><br />I had pretty good but not perfect results here: Baked Russet Potatoes (medium) were only partially cooked after 30 minutes when cooked at the maximum 400 degree setting, my convection oven cooks them much more completely in the same amount of time at the same setting. Sweet Potato Fries were kind of a disappointment as well, they just did not crisp up like they do in my standard convection oven. Chicken Breasts and battered shrimp cooked in here were done more to my satisfaction but I did note that Ineeded to keep the temp up about 25 degrees hotter than my standard oven to get the same result. French bread pizzas were a complete disaster when cooked on parchment paper - the paper caught fire. I checked the manual about using parchment paper - I use it all the time in my standard oven for all sorts of baking - and there was no warning about using it - but I can tell you it is a big no-no.<br /><br />Preheat Function:<br /><br />Well, this function is pretty worthless on my unit. I have successfully been able to use it and then cook exactly 2 times out of 10 in the 2 weeks I have had the unit. The first time we used this function the house smelled like it was on fire, the unit quit working and we thought it had burned up. The next time we used it, it cycled through the preheat and then the 10 minute after preheat time period and then shut down. (It completely turns off, including the time display and will not work at all.) The next time I let it cycle through (both the preheat and 10 minute cycle), the unit remained functional and I was able to convection bake afterwards. Then the hubby ran the preheat and interrupted the 10 minute after preheat cycle to attempt to convection cook - the unit shut down again. As I said, we have tried this 10 different times and never been able to use the convection function directly after the preheating is done. Even waiting after the 10 minute period of time is dicey, sometimes the unit remains functional, sometimes it shuts down. The hubby is frankly worried about this and so we never leave the kitchen when the unit is in use.<br /><br />Slim Fry:<br /><br />We have not tried this function yet but I will update when we do, perhaps this is the answer to my issues with oven fries!<br /><br />Overall, this is a better multifunction machine than I thought it would be. I was highly skeptical of the convection oven side of the equation as my prior experiences with these sort of units (toaster oven/convection oven) have lead me to conclude that they are okay at best. The oven on this unit really does a decent job with some finagling on the temperature side. (Ignore the standard advise to lower by 25 degrees vs. regular oven on this unit and you should be fine.)

For the first 13 months we loved this product, then the automatic open/close door feature stopped working. I called Panasonic and they were no help since it was out of warranty. I searched the internet for a authorized repair company and when I called them, they gave me a price of $295 to repair the problem (including travel), so we decided to live with manually opening and closing the door.<br /><br />3 months later, we were using the microwave and we noticed a burning smell. We shut the microwave off and waited a while and tried it again. Same thing only stronger smell.

So we stopped using the microwave.<br /><br />2 weeks ago we had a problem with the ice maker on our new GE profile refrigerator so I call a GE repair company who also repairs and warranties other manufacturers' products.

527,51401810,RKXNZX22HQZEE,B00NN136NQ,464779766,"samsung mc11h6033ct countertop convection microwave with 1.1 cu. ft. capacity, slim fry technology, grilling element, ceramic enamel interior, drop down door, and eco mode in stainless steel",3,182,192,Y,N,Takes your chef skills down a few notches,"I’m always leery of appliances that blend several functions or operations into one device. My past experience has been that it is better to get one appliance that does one thing well than to get one appliance that does three things mediocre. But one thing I can say after running this Samsung multi-function baking, broiling, microwave, convection oven through its paces, is that it really does everything very, very well. Because the interface is not intuitive (more on this in a moment), you will have to spend some time with the manual to figure out how to cook things the correct way or the way you want to. You will also have to extrapolate a little bit, because Samsung does not cover every possible foodstuff and every possible cook method. Still, by keeping the manual handy, I didn't have any problem making delicious food in any of the modes that I tried (everything except broiling – which looks like it would be quite messy).<br /><br />I started simple, with the microwave. While every microwave that I have touched in the past twenty years was literally self-explanatory, just choose a setting or power level and cook time, this Samsung oven requires you to select the type of food, the weight, what you are trying to accomplish (heat, defrost, etc.) and it calculates everything for you and runs it. Now, this sounds like a lot of tedious work, and in fact it is. But the first thing I defrosted was frozen Japanese sticky rice. In a regular microwave, I usually just put it in at high level for a minute, stir it up, and I end up with a sometimes mushy, sometimes not, sometimes cold, or cool, or hot, sometimes perfect, sometimes inedible bowl of rice. Using the bread setting on the Samsung, I put the rice in, pushed the buttons and turned the knobs according to the instructions, and I ended up with perfectly defrosted, not hot, not cold, not a grain neglected bowl of rice. It was, in a word, amazing: defrosted without even getting hot. Wow. The microwave continued to impress in this fashion: popping popcorn, defrosting frozen berries, warming cold bread, all to perfection.<br /><br />For baking or actual heating, again, following the instructions of the manual, I made a number of excellent dishes. What I failed to notice, however, was that the cook times for everything I made were predetermined by the oven. That is to say, before starting I never knew how long anything would take and in fact, until you push the start button, the oven never indicates the cook time you are in for. Because these were main dishes and the length of time was not egregious, this didn't matter for the most part, until I tried the slim fry function.<br /><br />Now, I have experience with these so called “oil-less” fryers, which is essentially what the Samsung oven turns itself into in the slim fry mode. So, I prepped my potatoes and waited for my wife to come home before starting on the main dish prep, but before I did that, I started on the potatoes. The first step was to fast preheat the oven to 400 degrees, and it has a dedicated mode for accomplishing this. I turned it on and set to work on my other dishes. Eight minutes later, I was ready to go, but the oven was still fast (?) preheating. I cut to the chase, put in my potatoes on the crisper tray, set it on the small rack that came with the oven (is there a reason why the tray does not sit in a fixed position on its sister rack?), selected my quantity and hit start. The timer promptly displayed a cook time of 32 minutes. Wait, 32 minutes? I could drive to McDonald’s, order fries, sit in the parking lot and eat them, go back in and get another order of fries and take them home to serve with dinner and I’d still have 5 or 10 minutes before my slim fries were ready with the Samsung. We had a fry-less dinner, and slim fries (admittedly, delicious, crispy and light fries) for dessert.<br /><br />I don’t know a serious chef who doesn't work within given time constraints. It’s part of the task after all. (There are even television shows on which cook time determines the success or failure of the celebrity chefs competing on the shows.) So if you ask me, how, exactly, is a chef supposed to get the most out of this Samsung, I have to answer honestly, I have no clue. Not knowing the cook time up front is a serious handicap. I suppose if you used it enough for a wide range of foods under an extensive range of conditions, and kept notes along the way, you could develop an accurate chart of cook times that would allow you to get the most from this oven. But as it is, I think this is a nice microwave with a lot of great features that is hard to use for much of anything else. Samsung has some good ideas and a great microwave, but with the quirky implements, required-reading manual and the “we’ll let you know when it will be done when we’re ready to let you know” feature, it is impossible to rate this any higher than three stars.e even television shows on which cook time determines the success or failure of the celebrity chefs competing on the shows.)

It is very specifically for counter-top use only and it has an EXTREMELY short cord.  The cord doesn't even reach to the far side of the microwave.  Expect to need an extension cord.  The unit is a tiny bit smaller than average, but not much.  It has a pull down door that doesn't lay flush when opened, which may be a problem for larger dishes, but I've yet to encounter an issue.  There is an internal light that turns on when the unit is operating and when the door is open.  It runs a lot quieter than any microwave I've ever seen, and does so in all four modes (microwave, convection oven, air fryer, and toaster oven/grill).  There is no timer, which I found odd, but I've been using the phone for that for so long, I barely notice.<br /><br />The settings make it super easy to use.  You can auto-reheat a dinner plate or a casserole with a single feature.  There is a convenient popcorn button.  I've heard stories of a friend without that feature trying to pop up a bag of microwave popcorn.  Six people.  One microwave.  No viable popcorn.  No such problem here.  One button and let it pop.<br /><br />There are also auto-cook features for pasta, beverage, chicken breast, frozen breakfast, and frozen dinner.  What? No frozen lunch?<br /><br />The air fry (or slim fry, however you want to call it) feature worked well for me, though I only tried homemade french fries.  It only works for this list of pre-programmed items:<br /><br />Frozen oven chips (aka french fries)<br />Frozen breaded prawns<br />Frozen chicken nuggets<br />Frozen potato croquettes<br />Frozen onion rings<br />Chicken wings<br />Homemade french fries (there is a recipe in the guide and it's good to read it first if you've never air fried these before)<br />Potato wedges<br />Drumsticks<br /><br />For using it as a toaster oven, or grill (it seems like they use the terms interchangeably) you put the thing you want to toast/grill on the high rack (included, as is the lower rack) and select grill.  For medium dark toast, I go three minutes on each side.  It comes it shockingly good, same as from any toaster.  I had low expectations for that one, but it worked really well.<br /><br />Overall, it does everything it says it does, and it does it very well.",1/8/2015,0.851537823677063,"['Setting', 'issue', 'specifically', 'use', 'EXTREMELY', 'short', 'cord', 'cord', 'even', 'reach', 'far', 'side', 'microwave', 'Expect', 'need', 'extension', 'cord', 'unit', 'tiny', 'bit', 'smaller', 'average', 'much', 'pull', 'door', 'lay', 'flush', 'opened', 'may', 'problem', 'larger', 'dishes', 'yet', 'encounter', 'issue', 'internal', 'light', 'turns', 'unit', 'operating', 'door', 'open', 'runs', 'lot', 'quieter', 'microwave', 'ever', 'seen', 'four', 'modes', 'microwave', 'convection', 'oven', 'air', 'fryer', 'toaster', 'timer', 'found', 'odd', 'using', 'phone', 'long', 'barely', 'br', 'br', 'settings', 'make', 'super', 'easy', 'use', 'dinner', 'plate', 'casserole', 'single', 'feature', 'convenient', 'popcorn', 'button', 'heard', 'stories', 'friend', 'without', 'feature', 'trying', 'pop', 'bag', 'microwave', 'popcorn', 'Six', 'people', 'One', 'microwave', 'viable', 'popcorn', 'problem', 'One', 'button', 'let', 'br', 'br', 'also', 'features', 'pasta', 'beverage', 'chicken', 'breast', 'frozen', 'breakfast', 'frozen', 'dinner', 'frozen', 'lunch', 'br', 'br', 'air', 'fry', 'slim', 'fry', 'however', 'want', 'call', 'feature', 'worked', 'well', 'though', 'tried', 'homemade', 'french', 'fries', 'works', 'list', 'items', 'br', 'br', 'Frozen', 'oven', 'chips', 'aka', 'french', 'fries', 'br', 'Frozen', 'breaded', 'prawns', 'br', 'Frozen', 'chicken', 'nuggets', 'br', 'Frozen', 'potato', 'croquettes', 'br', 'Frozen', 'onion', 'rings', 'br', 'Chicken', 'wings', 'br', 'Homemade', 'french', 'fries', 'recipe', 'guide', 'good', 'read', 'first', 'never', 'air', 'fried', 'br', 'Potato', 'wedges', 'br', 'Drumsticks', 'br', 'br', 'using', 'toaster', 'oven', 'grill', 'seems', 'like', 'use', 'terms', 'interchangeably', 'put', 'thing', 'want', 'high', 'rack', 'included', 'lower', 'rack', 'select', 'grill', 'medium', 'dark', 'toast', 'go', 'three', 'minutes', 'side', 'comes', 'shockingly', 'good', 'toaster', 'low', 'expectations', 'one', 'worked', 'really', 'br', 'br', 'Overall', 'everything', 'says', 'well']"

It looks great in our kitchen and the stainless steel matches our major appliances.  The black ceramic interior is also a nice touch - looks great and should be easy to clean.  The turntable is a bit larger than that of the countertop microwave it replaced, and in operation the microwave is very quiet.  One downside of this particular unit is it isn't the most powerful microwave out there - rated for 1000 watts compared to other 1200 and 1250 watt microwaves in this price range.  However, it is sufficient for home cooking tasks.  Setting the power and time is easy.<br /><br />The other function we've tried is the convection oven.  We used it to cook some frozen hors d'oeuvres (fancy name for pigs in a blanket) using the included metal racks and ceramic crusty plate.  Even though we preheated the oven as directed, we found we had to cook our food far longer than expected based on the time listed on the package, so there was no real time savings over using our conventional oven.  In addition, the exterior of the unit becomes *very* hot when using this mode.  I suspect that we will not be using the convection mode very often, though it is a nice feature to have.<br /><br />As for the Slim Fry / grilling / combined cooking modes, I have not tried these yet and I'm not sure I will.  These modes *seem* to use both microwave and convection heating, but it isn't clear how much of each from the very short included manual.  It is also very unclear when the included metal racks and crisping plate should and should not be used.  (Even looking through reviews and questions here you can see that Samsung is giving very inconsistent information on this subject.)  In any event, I will take other reviewers word for it that Slim Fry is a mediocre substitute for actual frying.  As for grilling, the grill elements only reach the back third of the oven, and I'm not sure it is worth the inevitable mess created to try grilling in this oven.<br /><br />So overall I would give this Samsung four stars for microwave cooking, three stars for convection cooking, and two stars for the other functions.  Four stars overall since it does its main job very well.h the inevitable mess created to try grilling in this oven.

It heats food quickly, is easy to use (once you review the manual), and can serve the same functions a microwave and toaster oven do.<br /><br />What makes this microwave different...<br />+ It has many possibilities.<br />+ Pizza is crispy on the bottom (when reheated) even on the microwave setting!<br />+ It can be simple, or you can dive into all the stuff it can do!<br />+ The size is comparable to our old 1.1 cu ft microwave, yet it can do more.<br />+ The colors are awesome!  The stainless is only on the front (which makes for less to clean) and the gray top and sides are not stainless---so they will keep cleaner.<br />+ The dials and quick microwave settings are smart.  To reheat something for 30 seconds, just press the button on the bottom right (once for 30 seconds, twice for a minute, etc.).  Or, press the microwave button, turn the dial to the time you'd like (backwards or forwards) and then press the start button.<br />+ The clock setting is easy to set.<br />+ The convection oven works for settings up to 400 degrees.  Preheat the oven first, and then select the convection oven.  You'll need to read the directions in the manual first, but then it's easy to navigate from there on out.<br />+ The oven includes a crispy plate, two wire racks (that worked great on the convection setting), a glass plate and ring.  I baked some cheese onto the plate while using the convection setting and it cleaned up super easy.<br /><br />What may concern you...<br />-  The microwave does need to be on a sufficiently powered circuit (not on a power cord).  It does not have a long cord, so you need to be able to place it right in front of the outlet you are going to use or close to it.<br />-  Don't use plastic plates that are not microwave safe.  One review for this microwave was mistaken--they said you couldn't use plastic in it.  Not true.  You just have to use microwave safe materials.  There's a thorough and easy to reference list in the manual (which is located inside the microwave oven when you unpack it).<br />- The oven does have a heating element on the top because it is a convection oven, so you will want to make sure you have a microwave safe plastic cover that you can use when you are microwaving.  Otherwise, it's going to be a pain to clean it up.<br /><br />Other matters to address...<br />It's always interesting to read other people's reviews.  One reviewer didn't like the manual, because a cookbook wasn't included.  Honestly, I've gotten so many cookbooks over the years with appliances and I've never used them.  The manual for this oven seems small, but it is packed with all the essential information you'll need to use it--and more.  No recipes, but all the guidelines for cooking vegetables, reheating foods, etc.  I don't cook in my microwave oven normally.  I did bake spinach artichoke dip in this oven, though, on 375 degrees for 30 minutes and it came out perfectly!<br /><br />Another reviewer lamented the lack of a timer on this microwave oven.  That's not true actually.  If you use the microwave function, the time counts down normally.  If you use the convection setting, you have to select how long you want the oven to cook for and then it will turn off automatically when it is done.  If you find you need a few extra minutes, it's very easy to turn it right back on.  To use the convection oven, you do need to preheat the oven first, but that's not a problem.  One feature that was awesome was that when I took my dish out of the oven to stir it, the oven did not start cooking again until I pressed the start button (so the time didn't keep going either).  Most people I know use the timers on their ovens or use a stand alone timer that they can take with them into another room if needed or move to where they will hear it when it goes off.<br /><br />All in all, I'm very pleased with this microwave.  It covers the basics and beyond very well!  I don't expect it to do everything--grill, slimfry, microwave, convection.  But, the fact that it microwaves and bakes so well is enough for me!  Many appliances claim to do too much and we expect one appliance to do it all.  I prefer to do grilled cheese on the stove and frying on the stove, so I don't want to do them in this oven and risk having to clean up a mess.  I'm extremely happy with what I've used it for so far.ics and beyond very well!  I don't expect it to do everything--grill, slimfry, microwave, convection.

I use a microwave to heat leftovers, cook frozen meals, make popcorn, melt butter or cheese, thaw frozen meat, reheat cold coffee, freshen stale bread of make it into croutons, cook sausages and hot dogs etc. I use this microwave several times per day.  I think my microwave usage is pretty typical.  The only thing I don't do in the microwave is prepare entrees from scratch (like cooking a roast or casserole). I've cooked all sizes of frozen entrees with no issues. Note, my review refers to an earlier model of this machine, which seems identical to this one that has replaced it.<br /><br />(1) Form factor. Because the guts of the machine are under the cooking chamber, this has the smallest possible footprint.  And because of the rounded back, I have it tucked into a corner of the countertop. This means I lose only 1' of countertop, and furthermore it's an awkward part of the countertop I wouldn't use for prep work etc because my elbow would bang into the fridge. Every other microwave I've ever owned took up 2' of prime, useable countertop. This makes such a huge difference in the usability and appearance of the kitchen that I'd give it five stars for this reason alone.<br /><br />The interior size of this machine is bigger than you'd think because it's round and all the space is useable. The round turntable entirely fills the rounded shape of the interior. An advantage of this is that nothing falls off into the corners as it cooks. I've occasionally thawed something bigger then the turntable (the sides and front of the microwave are square so this is possible) and it wasn't a problem.<br /><br />(2) Controls. I love love love the simplicity of the controls. It does exactly everything I need it to do in a way that is completely intuitive and simple. I should mention I own an Emerson microwave in my office that I have never yet beenable to figure out how to operate (and I'm of at least normal intelligence). The hated Emerson has lots of buttons and I'm sure it does a lot of things I don't need, but none of that matters because I'm not willing to learn a complex and counterintuitive interface to cook a frozen lunch entree. This Whirlpool, however, is amazing.  It has Power, Defrost, Reheat and Popcorn buttons, as well as a Plus (+) and Minus (-) and a Start and a Stop. I accomplish everything with the Plus, Minus. Start and Stop, and occasionally Power.<br /><br />To operate, you can just press the Plus until you reach the time you want, then press Start. Bam. You can't get any easier than that. The time increments get larger as you increase time, and this is absolutely not a problem. It uses 5 second increments up to 2 minutes, then 15 second increments to 3 minutes, then 30 second increments up to six minutes, then one minute increments from there. This is fine; I've never had an issue where using 6 or 7 minutes instead of 6.5 minutes caused a meal to fail (my pot pies call for 6.5 minutes at 50% power, and they're fine at either 6 or 7.  When I make popcorn, I always listen to the popping and stop it when it slows. That's because popping times depend much more on the freshness and moisture content of the kernels than the power of the microwave; this is true of every microwave. Similarly, when I'm thawing something I pay attention to the progress of it because again, the fat content of the food and how hard it's frozen makes all the difference in timing. I suspect there are fancy convention microwaves with thermal probes that allow completely mindless use, but that kind of ultra high-end microwave isn't what I want or need.<br /><br />I've been using an earlier model of this microwave for three years with absolutely no problem. I can't speak to specific reliability of the model here, but mine is the same in layout of controls, form factor, etc, so I would not hesitate to buy this one. In factI'm very tempted to buy one of these for the office and get rid of that annoying Emerson once and for all.",12/14/2014,0.2484632730484009,"['far', 'best', 'microwave', 'ever', 'owned', 'size', 'price', 'two', 'reasons', 'form', 'factor', 'simplicity', 'controls', 'use', 'microwave', 'heat', 'leftovers', 'cook', 'frozen', 'meals', 'make', 'popcorn', 'melt', 'butter', 'cheese', 'thaw', 'frozen', 'meat', 'reheat', 'cold', 'coffee', 'freshen', 'stale', 'bread', 'make', 'croutons', 'cook', 'sausages', 'hot', 'dogs', 'etc', 'use', 'microwave', 'several', 'times', 'per', 'day', 'think', 'microwave', 'usage', 'pretty', 'typical', 'thing', 'microwave', 'prepare', 'entrees', 'scratch', 'like', 'cooking', 'roast', 'casserole', 'cooked', 'sizes', 'frozen', 'entrees', 'issues', 'Note', 'review', 'refers', 'earlier', 'model', 'machine', 'seems', 'identical', 'one', 'replaced', 'br', 'br', 'Form', 'factor', 'guts', 'machine', 'cooking', 'chamber', 'smallest', 'possible', 'footprint', 'rounded', 'back', 'tucked', 'corner', 'countertop', 'means', 'lose', 'countertop', 'furthermore', 'awkward', 'part', 'countertop', 'would', 'use', 'prep', 'work', 'etc', 'elbow', 'would', 'bang', 'fridge', 'Every', 'microwave', 'ever', 'owned', 'took', 'prime', 'useable', 'countertop', 'makes', 'huge', 'difference', 'usability', 'appearance', 'kitchen', 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'reason', 'br', 'br', 'interior', 'size', 'machine', 'bigger', 'think', 'round', 'space', 'useable', 'round', 'turntable', 'entirely', 'fills', 'rounded', 'shape', 'interior', 'advantage', 'nothing', 'falls', 'corners', 'cooks', 'occasionally', 'thawed', 'something', 'bigger', 'turntable', 'sides', 'front', 'microwave', 'square', 'possible', 'br', 'br', 'Controls', 'love', 'love', 'love', 'simplicity', 'controls', 'exactly', 'everything', 'need', 'way', 'completely', 'intuitive', 'simple', 'mention', 'Emerson', 'microwave', 'office', 'never', 'yet', 'beenable', 'figure', 'operate', 'least', 'normal', 'intelligence', 'hated', 'Emerson', 'lots', 'buttons', 'sure', 'lot', 'things', 'need', 'none', 'matters', 'willing', 'learn', 'complex', 'counterintuitive', 'interface', 'cook', 'frozen', 'lunch', 'entree', 'Whirlpool', 'however', 'amazing', 'Power', 'Defrost', 'Reheat', 'Popcorn', 'buttons', 'well', 'Plus', 'Minus', 'Start', 'Stop', 'accomplish', 'everything', 'Plus', 'Minus', 'Start', 'Stop', 'occasionally', 'br', 'br', 'operate', 'press', 'Plus', 'reach', 'time', 'want', 'press', 'Start', 'Bam', 'ca', 'get', 'easier', 'time', 'increments', 'get', 'larger', 'increase', 'time', 'absolutely', 'problem', 'uses', 'second', 'increments', 'minutes', 'second', 'increments', 'minutes', 'second', 'increments', 'six', 'minutes', 'one', 'minute', 'increments', 'fine', 'never', 'issue', 'using', 'minutes', 'instead', 'minutes', 'caused', 'meal', 'fail', 'pot', 'pies', 'call', 'minutes', 'power', 'fine', 'either', 'make', 'popcorn', 'always', 'listen', 'popping', 'stop', 'slows', 'popping', 'times', 'depend', 'much', 'freshness', 'moisture', 'content', 'kernels', 'power', 'microwave', 'true', 'every', 'microwave', 'Similarly', 'thawing', 'something', 'pay', 'attention', 'progress', 'fat', 'content', 'food', 'hard', 'frozen', 'makes', 'difference', 'timing', 'suspect', 'fancy', 'convention', 'microwaves', 'thermal', 'probes', 'allow', 'completely', 'mindless', 'use', 'kind', 'ultra', 'microwave', 'want', 'br', 'br', 'using', 'earlier', 'model', 'microwave', 'three', 'years', 'absolutely', 'problem', 'ca', 'speak', 'specific', 'reliability', 'model', 'mine', 'layout', 'controls', 'form', 'factor', 'etc', 'would', 'hesitate', 'buy', 'one', 'factI', 'tempted', 'buy', 'one', 'office', 'get', 'rid', 'annoying', 'Emerson']"

If your microwave is like mine, with a turntable, the (factory) paint wore off in the path of the little wheels that turn the glass table.  (NOTE: My oven is at least 10 years old.)  I read the paint can's directions thoroughly, scraping off all the old, loose paint and rust.  The paint says use it in a well-ventilated area; I suggest you wait for a nice, low-humidity day and use the paint outdoors.  (It smells quite bad.)  Make sure you allow the paint to dry thoroughly before bringing it indoors; I also waited 24 hours before re-installing the turntable and using the microwave.<br /><br />Results:  Within 2 months, the paint had been worn off by the turntable wheels, and I'm back where I started before painting.  So -- I guess if you're repainting someplace that will NOT get any wear, this paint will work fine.  Under turntable wheels, not so much.<br /><br />PREVENTION ADVICE:  Make sure your microwave oven is clean and DRY after each use.

I just got a MC11H6033 1.1 cu.ft Counter Top Convection Microwave w/SLIM FRY as a gift. I contacted the chat support as I had a few questions, all of which were answered with, No, but only after I was basically told Yes to all three questions and then dared to question the Yes.<br /><br />I asked if there was a timer function, told yes, then told no after I asked the rep to tell me where it was located, and how to set and use it. Who makes a microwave in 2014 that doesn't have a timer?<br /><br />I asked if there was a more extensive food prep guide/recipe book available to use with the unit because the Microwave Oven Owner's Instructions & Cooking Guide literally only lists 1 food item per function. There's 1000s of foods that could be made using things like the Slim Fry function, but no way to know which of the 1-9 settings to use because there's only 9 food items listed in the Microwave Oven Owner's Instructions & Cooking Guide under the Slim Fry entry. There is apparently no app with this information available either. Neither is there a formula for figuring out how to Slim Fry additional foods other than those listed in the Microwave Oven Owner's Instructions & Cooking Guide. This problem persists throughout the Microwave Oven Owner's Instructions & Cooking Guide in that every function other than straight microwave or straight convection cooking does not give enough information to be able to choose the correct function and setting for foods other than those listed. I only found this information out after asking which setting to use to cook Pre-breaded Fried Okra. I was answered, You can use the slim fry option 2 for Pre-breaded frozen Fried Okra. I asked, How and where did you find that information? He replied, I have gathered the information from our internal database. I stated, I don't exactly have access to your internal database, now do I? So, no additional cooking info publicly available. I guess if I want to try to Slim Fry frozen cheese sticks, I'll need to contact Customer Service and ask which setting to use because apparently, in the world of frozen food, Pre-breaded frozen Fried Okra is equal to that of Frozen Prawns [shrimp], Breaded. That's the example food for Slim Fry option 2 as per the Microwave Oven Owner's Instructions & Cooking Guide.<br /><br />I asked if there were sheet pans, cookware, or bakeware available to be purchased from Samsung, or elsewhere, that were known to fit in the unit; specifically sheet pans. Standard size 1/4 (quarter) sheet pans won't fit because the 9.5 x 13 size is determined by the usable flat surface area and not the outside of the pan itself. No standard 9.5 x 13 sheet pan is 9.5 x 13 on the outside dimensions that I am aware of. SO, where would I get pans that fit? Apparently Customer Service, nor Parts, has a clue. Who makes the inside of an appliance, capable of being a convection oven, too small for standard size bakeware? Toaster ovens don't count - but they do at least have after-market sheet pans available out there that fit in them. If I'd wanted to make cookies on pans that small, I'd have expressed interest in a convection toaster oven to make 6 cookies at a time, not a convection microwave oven. It should also be noted the Microwave Oven Owner's Instructions & Cooking Guide makes a big deal out of you Choosing the Proper Cookware. This is covered from pg 22 to pg 25.<br /><br />I was told by Customer Service, initially, that what I was looking for was available, and to contact Parts about those last two questions. I did. I checked online and I called. The girl who answered actually hung up on me after I insisted that Customer Service had referred me and that indeed those parts should be available. After she ended our conversation abruptly, I brought the absence of those parts to the attention of the Customer Service rep I was chatting with.<br /><br />Other than the above, the straight microwave function and straight convection function work well. The drop-down oven style door is a really nice feature. The blue display lighting is pretty.<br /><br />How does a company make a product without giving the consumer, or providing to the consumer at an additional charge, adequate instruction or equipment to use their product? I just don't understand how someone puts out a product with 1000 uses and only reveals 20 of them. Obviously people like me don't test them out or question the developers or designers or engineers before putting a product on the market without adequate instruction or equipment to use their product.<br /><br />Obviously, my logic is lost on Samsung - or it's too complex a logic for someone who works there to have figured out. In any case, with a hefty $249 on sale to $399 full retail price tag; the MC11H6033 1.1 cu.ft Counter Top Convection Microwave with SLIM FRY is definitely not worth the money since you can't use it to it's full potential.<br /><br />Review Update:<br />So, as of Christmas Day, I still hadn't found a commercially available sheet pan that actually fit inside the unit. My mother gave me an old broiler pan that she had for a long gone oversized convection toaster oven.<br /><br />I was using just the convection oven feature on the unit for the first time (I'd only used the Slim Fry feature to that point) to cook a dish for Christmas dinner; all of a sudden it just stopped working. The unit head cut off and there was no display visible. I thought maybe I'd tripped the breaker. I unplugged the unit and checked; I had not tripped the breaker, but I turned it off and back on just to be sure. I plug the unit back in and nothing. I've been found something else to plug into that outlet so that I can make sure the outlet was in fact functioning correctly. It was. I then pulled out the owners manual and proceeded to the troubleshooting section. It recommended unplugging the unit for three seconds and plugging it back in. I unplugged it, and left it unplugged for a solid five minutes. I plugged it back in and still nothing.<br /><br />For a unit this expensive to conk out while using one of the features for the first time, definitely says nothing good about the unit. For the unit to conk out while making Christmas dinner; that was just a headache I didn't need that day. I would dub this a completely unreliable unit.<br /><br />I regret that I never did have the chance to try french fries using the Slim Fry option.",12/4/2014,-1.0,"['really', 'upset', 'got',

In the interests of everyone's time, it seemed reasonable to try replacing the unit.  I was told by Jason and Chris (supervisor) that Amana's policy was to repair not replace, so only option was A FOURTH service call to report the problem (per policy). I asked Chris whom I should direct concerns about this policy, and he said Customer Service.<br /><br />Less than helpful. I was fairly certain that I was already speaking with Customer Service.

Then I see a bunch of holes and a hole at the top where the cardboard was. Uh-oh! What did I just do? It is as thin as the cardboard on a school notebook, the thin kind, but it is silver in the light.  It looks like cardboard when you open the door. But how can that be, that I could take my fingernail and rip it out? And this is supposed to last for how long?    I called Whirlpool customer service, and the rep said she will send me the part. Then her manager said they don't have any parts so there is nothing they can do because I broke it. What? I ripped it with my fingernails and you are telling me this would have lasted how long anyhow?    I politely asked to speak with the supervisor. That took 15 minutes and he was so arrogant. But mam, you broke it. IT LOOKED LIKE cardboard and I ripped it with my fingernail. There is nothing we can do for you.    I can't take it back because the local store said that Whirlpool won't take it back. I will run the microwave until it dies and NOT BUY ANOTHER THING FROM WHIRLPOOL. I will call the attorney general and make a complaint against them.    I will never buy this again, or any appliance from Kitchenaid, Whirlpool, or Maytag!

We got this one because we are replacing a Samsung microwave oven which was fantastic.  I would say it was at least 15 years old.  It had the controls along the top which was a terrific approach to making a compact, usable microwave with a small horizontal footprint and large interior.  Samsung no longer makes a similar design.    The only microwave ovens we've been able to find with a numeric keypad on the top are commercial versions which run over $800.  We hoped this one would be acceptable, but it's not.  The controls on the bottom are even worse than the side from a usability point of view.  We find ourselves bending over to see the labels on the buttons.  We really miss the numeric keypad, also.

I used to have double wall ovens and a Jenn Air cooktop with grill/griddle. We've downsized but this oven gives me most of the benefits that I had with that setup.<br /><br />The small oven is perfect for 95% of the needs for my wife and I, but I do expect the large oven will get a work-out at Thanksgiving when we have at least 7 for dinner. The Power Boil is terrific, and the grill/griddle is very handy and easy to clean.<br /><br />I debated quite a bit between this and the PGB950SEFSS. The main differences:<br /><br />* This model has a porcelain top surface, the 950 is stainless<br />* The 950 has a double-ring, 19,000 BTU boil burner - this has a single-ring 17,000 BTU<br />* The 950 has dual broiler burners, this has one broiler<br />* The 950 has a ball-bearing roller rack (I believe just one of the three) where this has all standard slide racks<br />* $700 MSRP price difference<br /><br />To be honest I prefer the porcelain top surface of this oven aesthetically, but that's definitely a matter of opinion. The other features just didn't add up to $700 for me.

I just bought one today at a big box store at their regular price of $250. I bought the prior model to this one a little less than 4 yrs ago when I bought my new construction house and upgraded to stainless appliances. One day it worked fine, the next it would act like it was working, but the food wouldn't heat up. Microwaves are supposed to last approximately 9 yrs. I am not happy about having to spend another $250 after just barely 4 yrs. Shame on Whirlpool for making disposable appliances nowadays. I will say it is a nice looking microwave, but I agree with other reviews that the fan is useless. No suction at all if you place your hand under the filter. I also don't understand why most microwaves are rated at 1000 watts and every frozen dinner on the planet says it is tested with an 1100 watt unit. ???    On another note regarding Whirlpool in general I have the following to say. I bought all Whirlpool appliances when I bought my house and I will never spend another dime on Whirlpool again. The only reason I bought the Whirlpool microwave replacement is because my house is for sale and I don't want mismatched appliances. When the washer and dryer were delivered and installed the dryer had a noticeable knocking sound that the delivery guys blamed on flat drum rollers. The front load washer has a ridiculous time trying to balance a load during the spin cycle. The refrigerator has more sharp edges that I have cut myself on in the door compartments than you can shake a stick at. It also doesn't cool down a 12 pk of beer in any less than 12 hrs. I tried to cook a ham in the oven and followed the directions based on weight and temperature....cold ham! The dishwasher is ok but I hate the silverware basket. Not big enough for utensils with large handles. Whirlpool needs to wake up and build quality products that are functional and last. Never again.

This model has a TSB out for peeling door handles (as one other reviewer wrote). However, their review is not for this improved model. If you have an Advantium oven with the peeling door handle don't just order the handle - replace the whole door. It is a new handle design that addresses the problem. My door was replaced under warranty.<br /><br />Bought a new house, miss our oven so much we're having one installed here. If you're considering one remember this:<br /><br />1) You cannot run it as a microwave with the metal tray and/or racks in - it will dramatically shorten its life<br />2) You cannot run it as an oven without the metal tray at least in - it will dramatically shorten its life.<br />3) You cannot soak the control panel down with soapy water to clean it - you can short it out. You clean it simply by wiping with a microfiber cloth. Done.<br /><br />All three of these points are in the owner's manual - which I'm going to speculate a lot of people don't read. When I sold my last house I purposely put the owner's manual around all the racks outside of the oven and wrote a note to the new owner, &#34;do not use until you read.&#34;<br /><br />OK - rant over - here is the goods.<br /><br />This does almost everything. My fiance and I have used ours for:<br /><br />We have used it for proofing dough, as a warming oven, and we have used it for baking and cooking as a convection oven. It isn't quite a true second oven replacement (read on) but it provides completely even temperatures for baking so things like cookies, cakes, pies, etc. come out perfect every single time.<br /><br />You can program it to come on at a set time, cook for a set period, at a set temperature and then stop.<br /><br />The speed cook function is tremendous. It combines the microwave and halogen oven at the same time. Because the microwave is used at reduced power, you can use the metal tray (not the racks) for speed cook mode.<br /><br />You can bake two large potatoes, crispy skin on the outside (cooking trick, brush with olive oil for crispy skin and sprinkle with Kosher salt on the outside) in 13 minutes. They are fluffy inside, not microwaved &#34;streamed&#34; tasting.<br /><br />You can cook (reheat) frozen foods in 1/3 to 1/2 the time on the package. So frozen taquitos can be booked in 9 minutes instead of 27. You can bake crescent rolls in the can in about 1/2 the time you would in a conventional oven, crispy outside, flaky inside.<br /><br />There are hundreds of pre-programmed cook settings for a wide range of food items and dishes. Whether you're using it as a simple microwave to cook bacon, or you're using the speed cook function to roast meat. Yes, you can even roast in it.<br /><br />The capacity for a microwave is huge, at 1.7 cubic feet, and if you're a family of 2 or 3, you'll probably find yourself using this for most of your baking needs. I rarely used our oven.<br /><br />So what can't it do?<br /><br />Certain food types won't bake well using speed cook or the convection halogen cooking - that is why I say it isn't a perfect stand in for a second oven if you want 100% versatility. It can't broil (the 240 Volt version apparently can). In addition we have found certain vegetables, like whole spaghetti squash, or a whole roasted cauliflower, won't cook properly in the oven. The insides never seem to heat up when used strictly as a conventional convection oven. As a microwave or speed cook no problem.<br /><br />We found this to be a huge time saver - and we just bought this unit for installation in our home.<br /><br />Oh, and on the peeling handles - again that was the previous model. This model has the redesign and does not have that issue.ok mode.<br /><br />You can bake two large potatoes, crispy skin on the outside (cooking trick, brush with olive oil for crispy skin and sprinkle with Kosher salt on the outside) in 13 minutes.

Problems I found with it were mostly concerning the sensor cooking being completely inaccurate. Some items cooked or were warmed too little and some were much too hot. It was easier to simply time it myself.    But the straw that broke the camel's back for me on this unit was how long it lasted. It simply quit heating last week after being 35 months old. Everything else works but nothing gets warmed or cooked, leading me to believe the magnetron went bad. The microwave comes with a one year parts and labor warranty and a ten year parts only warranty on the magnetron. In speaking to an authorized repair center for Samsung, I was told I would pay a $99 trip charge to determine what is wrong, and if it is the magnetron, an order would be placed with Samsung for the part which will take three to six weeks to arrive and then I would have to pay another trip charge and labor to R & R the magnetron. Bottom line - even with the magnetron warranty, it will cost me more than I paid for the microwave to repair it.    I have had several microwaves since 1978 when they became popular. I have never had one that lasted less than 10 years. When this one went bad last week, I pulled out a countertop model Sharp Carousel that I bought 15 years ago and am using it, still working perfectly. I went to Lowe's where I purchased the unit and told the salesman that I went all Samsung three years ago while remodeling my kitchen and am now worried about the other units, particularly the refrigerator because it is making noise that it shouldn't. He told me that he has had more complaints about Samsung microwaves than any other brand and any other kind of appliance, and the only kind of appliance that Samsung has not had numerous complaints on is their ranges.    I have had serious issues with Samsung's customer service in the past due to owning many of their electronics. If you read any reviews about their service after the sale, you will find it is virtually nonexistent. But I wrote an email to Samsung letting them know that in my opinion, a microwave should last longer than three years and am very disappointed with the product. Naturally, I have not received a response of any kind.    I strongly suggest anyone considering buying a Samsung microwave to look elsewhere.

The manufacturing date on the unit was August 2012.  We moved in the house and began using the microwave in April 2013. The operation and capabilities were more than satisfactory.  I purchased a 4 year warranty extension in April 2013 through Whirlpool but is actually backed by Assurant Service Protection, Inc.<br /><br /> In July 2014, the microwave ceased to heat. I contacted the service department at Assurant who connected me with a local appliance repair business.  The appliance repair technician advised that this microwave unit is not serviceable.  So I went back to Assurant, who after several calls, offered approximately 75% of the cost of a new microwave as outlined in their service contract. If it had been within the first year of ownership, a new microwave would have been provided to me.<br /><br />The four year service contract cost $129.  The offer was for $178.  If I had it do again, I would have purchased a one year warranty extension for $30 instead of the four year warranty extension.<br /><br />I am going to replace the failed microwave with the same model so I can retain the custom trim and cabinetry in the kitchen.  I will purchase a 1 year extension so that I can repeat the replacement if necessary in a couple of years.  (I also ordered some parts for $30 through Amazon and will try, as an experiment, to repair the failed microwave.)",8/1/2014,0.5,"['exact', 'microwave', 'model', 'custom', 'installed', 'home', 'builder', 'using', 'trim', 'kit', 'manufacturing', 'date', 'unit', 'August', 'moved', 'house', 'began', 'using', 'microwave', 'April', 'operation', 'capabilities', 'satisfactory', 'purchased', 'year', 'warranty', 'extension', 'April', 'Whirlpool', 'actually', 'backed', 'Assurant', 'Service', 'Protection', 'br', 'br', 'July', 'microwave', 'ceased', 'heat', 'contacted', 'service', 'department', 'Assurant', 'connected', 'local', 'appliance', 'repair', 'business', 'appliance', 'repair', 'technician', 'advised', 'microwave', 'unit', 'serviceable', 'went', 'back', 'Assurant', 'several', 'calls', 'offered', 'approximately', 'cost', 'new', 'microwave', 'outlined', 'service', 'contract', 'within', 'first', 'year', 'ownership', 'new', 'microwave', 'would', 'provided', 'br', 'br', 'four', 'year', 'service', 'contract', 'cost', 'offer', 'would', 'purchased', 'one', 'year', 'warranty', 'extension', 'instead', 'four', 'year', 'warranty', 'br', 'br', 'going', 'replace', 'failed', 'microwave', 'model', 'retain', 'custom', 'trim', 'cabinetry', 'kitchen', 'purchase', 'year', 'extension', 'repeat', 'replacement', 'necessary', 'couple', 'years', 'also', 'ordered', 'parts', 'Amazon', 'try', 'experiment', 'repair', 'failed', 'microwave']"

In March of 2014 it started having the SE errors and similar to others on this site, would start on its own, night light would go off and on on its own, beep every 15 minutes, etc.<br />I tried all of the YouTube and other suggestions with removing the circuit board, cleaning all the connections. Originally this worked for two weeks, and then the problems restarted. Kept on repeating the process for the next 2 ½ months with the time interval getting shorter and shorter between cleanings.<br />The last time I left the power on when reinstalling the panel and the system worked fine. Oops, forgot to reinstall the circuit board mounting bracket.<br />Reinstalled the panel with the mounting bracket, again with live power and the SE error came on instantly.<br />Repeated the process three times, no errors without the circuit board mounting bracket; SE errors with the Circuit board mounting bracket.<br />With a large magnifying glass, I discovered a very, very small scratch on the ribbon cable between the circuit board and the control panel. This scratch lines up with a very sharp edge on the circuit board mounting bracket and it seemed that through vibration and general use; the ribbon cable was starting the have a direct contact between the embedded wires in the ribbon cable and the sharp edge of the mounting bracket, more than likely causing the strange SE errors.<br />I covered the sharp edge on the mounting bracket with electrician’s tape, as well as the ribbon cable where it bent around the mounting bracket projection.<br />Then while reinstalling the panel with live power, I tried twisting the panel, hitting it against the edge of the microwave, jiggling all the wires and all sorts of moves to see if the SE error would show up. No errors showed up.<br />The microwave has been working perfectly for two months now. It my case it is most likely that the manufacturing process was at fault for installing the ribbon cable tight against a sharp edge of the circuit board mounting bracket.<br />I would give this microwave 4 stars if it wasn't for the poor quality control during manufacturing.e manufacturing process was at fault for installing the ribbon cable tight against a sharp edge of the circuit board mounting bracket.<br />I would give this microwave 4 stars if it wasn't for the poor quality control during manufacturing.",7/28/2014,0.1370505392551422,"['may', 'may', 'solution', 'worked', 'br', 'purchased', 'January', 'March', 'started', 'SE', 'errors', 'similar', 'others', 'site', 'would', 'start', 'night', 'light', 'would', 'go', 'beep', 'every', 'minutes', 'br', 'tried', 'YouTube', 'suggestions', 'removing', 'circuit', 'board', 'cleaning', 'connections', 'Originally', 'worked', 'two', 'weeks', 'problems', 'restarted', 'Kept', 'repeating', 'process', 'next', 'months', 'time', 'interval', 'getting', 'shorter', 'shorter', 'br', 'last', 'time', 'left', 'power', 'reinstalling', 'panel', 'system', 'worked', 'fine', 'Oops', 'forgot', 'reinstall', 'circuit', 'board', 'mounting', 'br', 'Reinstalled', 'panel', 'mounting', 'bracket', 'live', 'power', 'SE', 'error', 'came', 'br', 'Repeated', 'process', 'three', 'times', 'errors', 'without', 'circuit', 'board', 'mounting', 'bracket', 'SE', 'errors', 'Circuit', 'board', 'mounting', 'br', 'large', 'magnifying', 'glass', 'discovered', 'small', 'scratch', 'ribbon', 'cable', 'circuit', 'board', 'control', 'panel', 'scratch', 'lines', 'sharp', 'edge', 'circuit', 'board', 'mounting', 'bracket', 'seemed', 'vibration', 'general', 'use', 'ribbon', 'cable', 'starting', 'direct', 'contact', 'embedded', 'wires', 'ribbon', 'cable', 'sharp', 'edge', 'mounting', 'bracket', 'likely', 'causing', 'strange', 'SE', 'br', 'covered', 'sharp', 'edge', 'mounting', 'bracket', 'electrician', 'tape', 'well', 'ribbon', 'cable', 'bent', 'around', 'mounting', 'bracket', 'br', 'reinstalling', 'panel', 'live', 'power', 'tried', 'twisting', 'panel', 'hitting', 'edge', 'microwave', 'jiggling', 'wires', 'sorts', 'moves', 'see', 'SE', 'error', 'would', 'show', 'errors', 'showed', 'br', 'microwave', 'working', 'perfectly', 'two', 'months', 'case', 'likely', 'manufacturing', 'process', 'fault', 'installing', 'ribbon', 'cable', 'tight', 'sharp', 'edge', 'circuit', 'board', 'mounting', 'br', 'would', 'give', 'microwave', 'stars', 'poor', 'quality', 'control', 'manufacturing', 'process', 'fault', 'installing', 'ribbon', 'cable', 'tight', 'sharp', 'edge', 'circuit', 'board', 'mounting', 'br', 'would', 'give', 'microwave', 'stars', 'poor', 'quality', 'control', 'manufacturing']"

(We actually have the black version, but it is otherwise identical.)  The Samsung obviously shares the same basic design as the GE with a redesigned front panel.  I knew and trusted the Samsung brand from our personal electronics (such as several smartphones), so picked one of these up on sale at a local retailer.  Unfortunately, what I got was a bare-bones minimal redesign with major flaws.  It's like they took the basic GE design, made it super cheap, and replaced the panel with a terrible non-intuitive redesign.<br /><br />Installation was easy - I was even able to use the original rear mounting plate as the Samsung was, indeed, a twin of the GE series.  This microwave fit perfectly into our 30 wide opening with very minimal gaps on each side.  I had to drill new holes through the cabinet above, however, as the top was slightly different.  The height is 16 for the main cabinet, 16 5/8 to the very bottom of the light box underneath (not shown in the picture, but it's there).  I plugged it in and quickly realized that this sure isn't the same quality as the GE was.<br /><br />The first and most annoying thing is the user interface on the front panel.  The buttons are hard to interpret, and things that are easy on the GE are now impossible or very confusing.  Heating a beverage is common, right?  No beverage button on this unit - you need to discover the button to press is COOK, and then wait for the slowly scrolling text to confirm you are correct and need to press 1 next.<br /><br />What about canned vegetables?  There's a VEGGIES button, so this should be easy.  Not so!  Press the button, and across scrolls: SELECT ... (pause) ... 1 FOR ... (pause) ... FRESH ... (pause again) ... VEGGIES ... (um, I know it's vegetables, I just pressed the button!) ... 2 FOR ... (yet ANOTHER pause) ... FROZEN ... (darn, guess it must be 3) ... VEGGIES ... clear ... SELECT ... (oh no! where can frozen veggies be?!) ... etc.  At least the SELECT doesn't scroll when it appears, only when it's scrolling away.  But the worst part is seeing the VEGGIES on the display, alone, as I wait, knowing full well I pressed the veggies button.<br /><br />And I still have trouble figuring out which button is for the fan and which is for the light.  Making it worse is that there is one button for the light (HI/LO/OFF) and 2 buttons for the fan (ON/OFF and 4 speed).  Actually, there is another button each for some obscure settings we never use.  Sure, there are some tiny dark grey letters showing which set of button is which, but those are only visible up close in bright light.<br /><br />Gone are the easy 1-button 1 to 6 minute quick start buttons.  Now it takes 4 button presses to do the same thing, although at least there is still a button to add 30 seconds.  I could go on and on about the poor interface, but I think you get the idea.<br /><br />Next major issue: the stovetop light is way dimmer than the GE was.  Even though there are 2 places in the design for bulbs, and my GE had 2 halogen bulbs, this one has a SINGLE incandescent bulb - not bright at ALL.  This is huge, as we use our stovetop frequently and now it is always poorly lit.<br /><br />And a another biggie: when the timer finishes, it gives 4 short, quiet beeps, and stops.  No repeat, nothing more.  So unless you are right by it, it is pretty much worthless.  We can now only use our oven timer - so no more dual timers when we are cooking different things.  I can't even count how many things have overcooked or been ruined because of the lame timer.<br /><br />The look is also unattractive.  The lightbox hangs down below the lower front plastic panel, ensuring everyone knows how tacky this microwave is.  Even the display is an ugly old-fashioned blue 14-segment per digit 7-digit display.  Most calculators have better!  Actually, I kind of like the blue.  Everything else in my kitchen is amber, so it creates a nice contrast.<br /><br />Furthermore, it is noisy.  It frequently makes weird grinding-like noises from the bottom right (I think it is a fan or the microwave element) - if I tap it there it usually diminishes or goes away for a while.<br /><br />Finally, the front glass broke once when we were opening the door a couple of months after getting it.  Samsung did send out a repairman within 2 weeks and repaired it under warranty and it hasn't happened again in the many months since.<br /><br />Is there anything I like about this microwave?  Well, it works.  It has a turntable.  It has sensor cooking.  And it has dual grease-filters on either side of the bottom with a powerful exhaust fan (that has 4 levels when not using the microwave, 2 when in use).  It also has an easy-to-clean all-white interior.  And it was less expensive (on sale) than the similar GE units - but rightly so.<br /><br />PROS<br />It works.<br />Sensor cooking.<br />Dual grease filters.<br />Easily fits space replacing similar GE models.<br /><br />CONS<br />Horrible user interface.<br />Poor single-bulb incandescent stovetop lighting.<br />Loud, obnoxious noises.<br />Cheap looking.<br />Worthless kitchen timer.s amber, so it creates a nice contrast.<br /><br />Furthermore, it is noisy.

We have a GE in-cabinet microwave/oven combo unit so when the paint began to peel off the top of the microwave I was really worried because to replace this unit it is over $1000 due to it being a specialty item.  So I sanded down the top of the microwave really well.  Be sure to get ALL loose paint off - should be totally smooth.  Then when the paint arrived I shook it up real well and applied a coat to the top of the microwave.  It was actually a pretty good sized area I needed to cover.  After letting that coat dry for a couple hours I added a second coat and after a couple more hours I added a third coat.  I want to make sure it was coated good.  So far we have used it for a few weeks and it still looks great.  I showed it to my son and he said the inside looked brand new now!  I let it dry for 36 hours before use as the can didn't have any recommendations or directions for how long to let dry before use.  The smell is overwhelming and I would suggest using eye protection if you must use it inside as the fumes come out toward your face.  I would take a counter top unit outside to treat.

If you live in a small apartment, counter space is typically premium real estate and a microwave eats up quite a bit of that space. That was the case in our place. We had our old microwave on top of the refrigerator because we couldn't sacrifice what little counter space we had. That had its own problems because neither one of us is tall so reaching up with a spatula to remove a microwave dish had a few drop events. Not fun.<br /><br />Our old one recently conked out so off I went in search of a small unit. I saw this one and had a Eureka moment. Since it is only about 14 inches wide, I thought it would fit in the corner next to the coffee maker and once set up, it's great. It does take up space but there is now room for the essentials on the counter since this tucks nicely into the corner.<br /><br />The only issue that we had with this unit is that we have the old school laminated counter top in beige in our kitchen and sliding this into the corner resulted in black lines being drawn on the formica from the feet of the microwave. A magic eraser got rid of that.<br /><br />The other minor thing is that when on the laminate counter, the microwave slides when you try to open the door. They should have built this with non-slip feet.

We immediately noticed that from that point on the microwave would not heat food unless the vent fan was running. (even if the stove was off and cold)  After the next service call, the microwave still wasn't heating food without the vent fan running despite the technician replacing a part and the microwave vibrating and humming whenever the vent fan was on after his repair.

I bought this based on great reviews.  While it's a basic unit, which is what I wanted, it seems to be lacking in a couple of areas.  First, I didn't realize there were still microwaves that did not have instant-on for one minute when you press 1, two minutes for 2, and so on.  This doesn't do that.  Also, I knew it was big, but didn't realize it was going to be 2 inches taller and deeper than my old unit.  It's almost to the point of looking too big for the space.  Yes, i could have measured since the dimensions are listed.  My old oven had two lights underneath for lighting the range top.  This has one small bulb, and seems a little inadequate.  As others have said, I'm not sure if I'm sold on the upward facing vent.  It makes the front look clean, but seems like a funnel for things to fall into it.  The LED readout is big and blue, and while it's not unattractive, blue lights are blurry to me, so it's harder to read than my old green readout.<br /><br />On the plus side, this is a nice big, powerful microwave, that looks nice in the space.  It's got some nice touches, like a 30-minute fan-off timer.

It would actually run, just would not heat the food.<br /><br />From extensive research, I figured out which components, when broken, would allow my microwave to run but just not heat.  The list below is from the most likely to least likely cause of the problem.<br /><br />1. Diode<br />2. Magnetron  [many times #1 & #2 happen together]<br />3. Capacitor<br />4. High Voltage Regulator<br />5. Control circuit board<br /><br />90%+ of the time it is #1 or #2 and most likely both.<br /><br />For me, it was both.<br /><br />When I ordered the above diode I tested it with an Ohm [volt] meter and a 9v batter.  The original had current both ways.  The new one allowed current only one way - that's the correct result.<br /><br />Tests on my old and new magnetrons with the Ohm meter had the same results (no battery needed for this).  Both tests read as a closed circuit (or 0.00 on my Ohm meter).  So I wasn't sure if the original Magnetron was actually broken or not.<br /><br />So to check this, I kept the old Magnetron installed and just installed the new diode (plenty videos on youtube on this).<br /><br />No heat. Problem NOT fixed.<br /><br />So then I replaced the Magnetron and kept the new diode in place. New Magnetron.  New Diode.<br /><br />Success.....my microwave works. Yay!<br /><br />Hope this helps.<br /><br />PS.  I ended up getting the an exact copy of the above Samsung OM75P(10) Magnetron for $52 (total final price)on another site.<br /><br />PSS.

Presumably they delete any negative reviews.

You've got to be kidding me!,"We bought this for our kitchen remodel to fit in the island in July 2012.  I don't like having the micro over the stove because I do a lot of canning and wanted a great range hood.  The heat from canning tends to melt the electronics in micros over the stove after about a few seasons.<br />Once it was in, I was never completely happy because it took a long time to reheat food and didn't seem to reheat evenly.  Not a big deal since we only used it for leftovers....and it looked good tucked away under the counter.<br />When I bought it, I couldn 't find many reviews on it - good or bad, but figured it would be fine-especially with the high price tag.<br />Wrong!<br />It just died with no warning.  Our $199 over the stove micros lasted longer!  I could have melted 4 or 5 of those for the price of this one!<br />I'm going to try to fix it because now I have a custom island built to fit this specific microwave.  Save your money, buy a countertop model and whatever you do,  DO NOT build cabinetry to fit this piece of junk!<br /><br />UPDATE: I was able to have this fixed by a local guy.  Apparently there was some bad circuitry that he was able to replace. Glad I don't have to find a new microwave to fit the space, but I still wouldn't recommend it.

The good:  It looks nice; the stainless steel finish must have some kind of coating on it because it's much easier to clean than some of my other steel appliances; the overall size is decent on the inside.  When it's cooking, I have to say this is the quietest microwave I've ever owned.    The not-so-good:  I've never had an over-the-range microwave with the handle on the door before and I hadn't really given that feature much thought before making the purchase.  It looks nice and all, but the handle gets untouchably hot if you're cooking on the stove;  I don't think I'd ever buy another with a handle again because it's kind of a nuisance to have to use an oven mitt to open the microwave (even more of a nuisance if I forget to use a mitt and put my hand on hot stainless steel).  It's very hard to see inside of when food is cooking.  There's one bulb and it's quite dim, plus the door has a screen-printed pattern on it that makes it even harder to see into.  The exhaust fan for the range technically has two settings, but they sound almost identical... and it's VERY loud. If the microwave is running for a long period of time or if it starts getting overheated from the stove below, the fan automatically turns on.  It's a smart feature to prevent it from overheating, but again the fan is super loud, and you can't manually turn it off once it kicks on.    The bad:  Oh. My. God.  The freakin' beeps when it's done cooking are INSANE!  I've never, ever had a microwave that didn't stop beeping upon the door being opened.  Not only does this continue, but the 3 beeps are extremely loud and at least 5-6 seconds long each!  And if you don't open the door in a timely fashion, it doesn't remind you with a gentle, short beep;  instead you get the same 3 ear-shattering YokoOno-screeching beeps every 2 minutes.  I've found that if you hit the stop/cancel button before opening the door, it'll stop the beeping... but again, it's another nuisance that I've never had to deal with in any previous microwaves.    The other bad thing I've found is that the touch pad scratches EXTREMELY easily.  I only use a microfiber cloth on it and it still looks like I went at it with steel wool covered in broken glass.  I tried using a plastic/fiberglass polish and it didn't do a thing.  However, I've found that using granite countertop cleaner/polish at least minimizes the look of the scratches a bit.

This thing is a knockout!!,"We've had the big 'ol &#34;over-the-range massive GE microwave that was powerful enough to cook a buffalo and was big enough to fit the beast inside but, when we redesigned our kitchen and put in a new pro-style stove and an elegant curved glass vent over it, that oversized radar box had to go! But what to get to replace it? Looked at all the allegedly compact countertop units and rejected every one of them -- &#34;compact&#34; they were not!<br /><br />And then we found this Whirlpool TV set, er, I mean microwave! Whomever designed this deserves a Nobel Prize for peace, physics and common sense!! It looks just like a cute little old school TV set. Imagine that! A cute microwave oven! But what's even better is how this thing disappears right into the corner of our new countertop. Somehow they figured out how to use the corner to their design advantage and here's the best: you can place a full-size 11&#34; dinner plate inside! How'd they do that??!!<br /><br />Negatives? Nothing terrible. Yes, it's only 750 watts vs the 1200 of our former &#34;beast-master&#34; machine but, as another reviewer said, just 'cause it fits a turkey and has the power to cook it doesn't mean ya should!! We use our microwave for vegetables, eggs, liquids, popcorn -- all of which the new cute Whirlpool TV/microwave thingee will do just fine. Takes an extra 15-30 seconds because of the lower power. That just gives me a little extra time to stare at this awesome box and marvel at how truly cool it is.<br /><br />And speaking of boxes, this is serious out-of-the-box thinking about appliances and how they fit into our lifestyles. Major kudos to Whirlpool for taking the initiative to see things a little different. Steve Jobs would have loved this microwave -- form and style perfectly matched with function.

I really didn't like the way it functioned compared to previous microwaves I have owned. but it looked good, and worked fine; UNTIL YESTERDAY.<br /><br />Out of nowhere, it just went up in flames, it wasn't even in use at the time.<br /><br />The only one in the house was my 72 yr. old mother-in-law, she said she noticed earlier that morning, the display on the microwave was off and she was unable to use it (as if it was unplugged). A while later, the house filled with smoke. Smoke and  flames were shooting out of the top vent of the microwave. She said there was so much smoke she could not even see in the kitchen.  She called 911, the fire dept was dispatched, and she exited our home. By the time they arrived the fire had burned out on its own, and the damage was contained to the internals of the microwave. The fire crew removed the microwave from my home, and inspected the home to insure that the microwave was indeed the cause of the fire. Thankfully there was no damage to our home other than the microwave itself, and a strong odor of smoke and burnt plastic (I'm sure it will take weeks to get rid of the smell).<br /><br />I contacted Samsung, to report what happened and am awaiting a response from the Executive Customer Relations dept. do to the nature of the incident.<br /><br />I'm not really sure what I want from them, more than anything to create awareness. Maybe they will issue a recall, based on this and all of the negative reviews I have read here on Amazon. I would encourage others having problems with this model to report it to Samsung. It may not do you much good, but who knows, you could save a life or something.<br /><br />UPDATE 01/31/2014:<br />Samsung Executive Customer Relations department contacted me on 01/20/2014 (MLK Holiday), by telephone (cell phone). I was asked to provide the microwave serial number but did not have it with me, so we agreed that I would provide it via email. A short time later I received an email asking to provide the serial number as Samsung would like to locate a service center to diagnose the unit.  I responded later that day with the serial number.<br /><br />On 01/21/2014 I received a response which stated, based on the serial number provided, the microwave is out of warranty, but due to the nature of the problem Samsung will cover the cost of diagnostics, and a service center will contacting me.<br /><br />On 01/22/2014 I received a call from the service center informing me they received the service order from Samsung, but it states the microwave is out of warranty so I will be responsible for the payment, I asked them to double check with Samsung, but they said I would have to contact them. I sent an email explaining what the service center said, and a few hours later Samsung responded with a One time Accommodation for the labor which I assume was also sent to the service center.<br /><br />A few days later the service center contacted me again, explaining they received the accommodation from Samsung, and asked if I could deliver the microwave to them, which I agreed (they were only about 1 mile from my home).<br /><br />On 01/29/14 the service center contacted me to explain that several parts in the microwave short circuited, and required replacement.  They explained that the accommodation was for diagnostic labor only, and any further repair would be my responsibility.  They asked for direction; explaining that the parts required are expensive, and the repair would most likely exceed the cost of replacement.<br /><br />I sent another email to Samsung explaining the call from the service center.  I explained that I made it a point to buy appliances from well know major brands such as Samsung with the expectation of higher quality and long life.  I asked that given the fact the unit failed due to a short circuit, after such a short life, under normal residential use, that they consider replacing the microwave at no cost, despite the fact the warranty period had ended.

Choose this one!,"We initially were happy with our purchase of this microwave, although it did not have the features of the older, more expensive Dacor microwave it replaced.  The size was great, and we liked the easy clean interior.<br /><br />However, six months after it was purchased (right before Christmas), it failed totally - would not power up at all.  I called Samsung customer service, they said a tech would get in touch shortly.  After 3 days a local repair company called to say they only came to our area once a week, so it would be several days before they could stop by.  We're 30 miles from Salt Lake City in Park City, a major resort town with a winter population of 100,000 people, so it's not like we're in the sticks.<br /><br />Nine days after I called, the repair service showed up.  He repaired one part, then stated that the magnetron was damaged, and that he would need to take the microwave to his shop for more diagnosis and repair.  Then he would have to order parts, then he would bring it back when his route brought him to our area again - so, two more weeks at least (assuming Samsung has the parts in stock).  On the way out of the door he banged the microwave into our door frame, putting a major dent in it.<br /><br />I called Samsung customer service again, and stated that I thought three weeks or more was too long to repair the unit.  They blamed the tech for not bringing all the parts he might need (what, a whole microwave?) but refused to offer to even expedite parts to the repair shop to cut a week off the time, let alone discuss any kind of replacement.<br /><br />With a family of 5, we use a microwave multiple times a day.  Samsung should have better quality in the first place.  When they have a failure, they need to have a better repair and support system in place, and if they can't do better than 3 weeks or more to repair an appliance that gets used daily, that's not good enough for me.  Do you need a failure like this right before you have family coming for the holidays? Would you be happy to spend weeks with a giant empty space in your kitchen where your microwave (and oven hood) was?<br /><br />We don't. No more Samsung appliances for us.  And good luck to Samsung in taking on Whirlpool, Bosch, Asko, Panasonic, etc. - the other appliances we have in our house which have worked great with daily use for years.  I'm off to the store for another brand of microwave, look for this one on eBay - still under warranty!<br /><br />By the way, we tried to post a version of this review (edited in accordance with Samsung.com's review guidelines) on Samsung.com, where Samsung supposedly allows customers to rate their products (and this microwave currently has a 4 star review).  We received a notice today that they would not post our review--no rationale, only that it did not meet their standards.

GE says the problem is with the keypad but that there aren't any more keypads to buy, probably because they all fail. The Advantium is a piece of junk. Save yourself money and protect your family from this potential fire hazard: avoid GE appliances.    [Update: after several calls and an eternity on hold GE acknowledged the problem and send a tech with a new Advantium that seems to be working well. I wouldn't buy another -- there are clearly QA issues with the Advantium -- but after lots of time on the phone GE did make this right. I'd still prefer a different manufacturer though and wish I'd bought a different cooker. If you're in the market for a microwave/cooker buy a different one.]",11/19/2013,0.04421842098236084,"['searching', 'others', 'problem', 'found', 'reviews', 'Advantium', 'died', 'years', 'work', 'home', 'one', 'day', 'smelled', 'smoke', 'traced', 'Advantium', 'turned', 'turned', 'time', 'hot', 'touch', 'unplugged', 'Advantium', 'smoke', 'smell', 'went', 'away', 'spontaneously', 'turned', 'melting', 'Plugging', 'back', 'turns', 'without', 'pressing', 'buttons', 'GE', 'says', 'fire', 'hazard', 'supposed', 'safety', 'prevent', 'burning', 'house', 'sure', 'credibility', 'shot', 'even', 'safety', 'built', 'low', 'quality', 'Advantium', 'reasonably', 'relied', 'upon', 'GE', 'says', 'problem', 'keypad', 'keypads', 'buy', 'probably', 'fail', 'Advantium', 'piece', 'junk', 'Save', 'money', 'protect', 'family', 'potential', 'fire', 'hazard', 'avoid', 'GE', 'appliances', 'Update', 'several', 'calls', 'eternity', 'hold', 'GE', 'acknowledged', 'problem', 'send', 'tech', 'new', 'Advantium', 'seems', 'working', 'well', 'would', 'buy', 'another', 'clearly', 'QA', 'issues', 'Advantium', 'lots', 'time', 'phone', 'GE', 'make', 'right', 'still', 'prefer', 'different', 'manufacturer', 'though', 'wish', 'bought', 'different', 'cooker', 'market', 'buy', 'different', 'one']"
1067,52072264,R1FEVPTESSYGBZ,B000W3PH1W,721617315,pem31dmww%2d profile spacemaker ii%2dcountertop microwave oven %2d white,5,0,0,N,Y,DOES THE JOB,"DESCRIPTION<br />&#62; Can be mounted in a 24&#34; wide X 12&#34; deep space.  Not intended to be installed above a range (standard ranges are 30&#34; wide), does not include a built-in hood for use above a range.<br />&#62; Has the great simple operation of previous Spacemakers: for example to heat a cup of coffee 1 minute, place it in the microwave and press &#34;1&#34;.  That's all.<br />&#62; Well built, albeit with more plastic and less metal than my old Spacemaker II.<br />&#62; Quieter than my old Spacemaker II--although that's no big deal.<br />&#62; The turntable is a nice addition (my old Spacemaker II did not have a turntable), but reduces the total space available (unless you turn the turntable off).<br />&#62; Has all of the controls and options of my old Spacemaker II:<br />...Plus popcorn, &#34;beverage&#34;, &#34;reheat&#34;, &#34;chicken/fish&#34;, &#34;potato&#34;, and &#34;vegetable&#34; buttons (which I probably won't use because I like to know what the microwave is doing).<br />...Other new buttons are &#34;delay start&#34;, &#34;reminder&#34;, &#34;turntable on/off&#34;, and &#34;add 30 sec&#34;.  The &#34;add 30 sec&#34; works on its own, you can press it and get just 30 seconds OR add 30 seconds to any time.  30 seconds is ideal for warming a cup of coffee, or heating some pastries.<br />...There is a child lockout, but without a dedicated button.<br /><br />UNDERCOUNTER INSTALLATION<br />&#62; The microwave itself comes with a paper template for drilling the necessary holes, but the template can be confusing and may not apply in all cases.<br />&#62; The microwave hangs from four ~1 1/4&#34;-long machine screws, which are inserted from above, from inside the cabinet above.  If the floor of the cabinet is greater than 1/2&#34; thick, then the length of the screws needs to be equal to the thickness of the floor plus 1/2&#34;.<br />&#62; Hypothetically, you could install the microwave with the four screws from your local hardware store, and 4 big washers (e.g., 2&#34; in diameter).  However the installation kit is probably easier.<br />&#62; If you use the template, double check the logic, and adjust the location of the screw holes accordingly.<br />... The key measurement is the distance from the front holes to the front of the cabinet. You usually want the front of the microwave to be flush with the front of the closed doors of the cabinet.  (That is, the front holes should be approximately 3 1/4&#34; back from the front of the closed doors).<br />... The door of the microwave needs an extra 1/8&#34; on the left in order to open fully, and the grill for the ventilation fan is on the left side of the microwave.  If there is an obstruction on the left side (such as wall, cabinet, or refrigerator), you may wish to shift the holes 1/4&#34; to the right, if you can.<br /><br />UNDERCOUNTER INSTALLATION KIT<br />&#62; If this is an new undercounter installation, or the space between the front and back screw holes (inside the cabinet above the microwave) is not ~6 1/4&#34;, then you need GE part #WX4-A019 [[ASIN:B001H815TO GE Part Number WX4-A019 UNDER CAB MT]].  If you are replacing a Spacemaker with a distance of ~6 1/4&#34; between the front and back holes, then you probably do NOT need an installation kit.<br /><br />IF YOU ARE REPLACING AN OLD SPACEMAKER II (for which the spacing between the front and rear screw holes is ~7 3/4&#34;)...<br />&#62; I purchased this Profile Spacemaker to replace a 23-year old Spacemaker II.  But neither the holes, backing plate, nor the screws were the same.<br />&#62; The spacing from the cabinet front to the forward screw holes is almost the same for my old Spacemaker II and this new Profile Spacemaker.<br />&#62; The lateral spacing (side-to-side) between the screw holes is the same 19 15/32&#34; for my old Spacemaker II and this new Profile Spacemaker.<br />&#62; But the spacing between the front and rear holes is NOT the same (the new spacing is 6 1/4&#34;).<br />&#62;So, if the holes in your cabinet are for the old Spacemaker II, then you need only drill new rear holes in your cabinet for this Profile Spacemaker.  Draw a line on the cabinet between the centers of the existing front and back holes, measure 6 1/4&#34; back from the center of the front hole, and drill the new hole there.<br />&#62; The screws seem to be very similar, but a slightly different diameter or pitch (perhaps they are metric). Hypothetically, you could drill new holes in the old backing plate (or use washers instead of the backing plate), and find screws the right size and length, but I decided to purchase the new kit instead.<br /><br />BEFORE YOU REPLACE A DEAD MICROWAVE OVEN ...<br />&#62; My old Spacemaker II died three times over 23 years as the result of power surges (lightning).  I accidentally learned that the trick is to unplug the microwave overnight for the electronics to reset.  I've had the same experience with several other appliances.<br />&#62; Even refrigerators and clothes driers have built-in computers these days.  If any electric appliance is not working properly, unplug it, and leave it unplugged a while.  For some reason (perhaps large capacitors in the circuit) big appliances usually need hours to reset.<br /><br />RELIABILITY<br />If my experience with my old Spacemaker II is any indication, this Profile Spacemaker should be very reliable.  Although resurrected 3 times over 23 years, my old Spacemaker was still working when I &#34;took it out of service&#34;.  After 23 years of daily use, some of the white finish was turning yellow, there were patches of rust inside, and the door switch (which turns the light on and off) was erratic.<br /><br />IF YOUR OLD SPACEMAKER HAD A TRAY INSTEAD OF A TURNTABLE, keep the tray from your old microwave.<br />&#62; The tray will fit in your new Profile Spacemaker.  The tray will catch spills and protect the bottom of the microwave from abrasion and burnt-on spills (which may promote rust in the future).<br />&#62; I use the glass tray when I'm using a large rectangular casserole, or many small containers.  I often warm two 12&#34; diameter full plates of food---I use a small glass storage container as a spacer so that the plates can overlap.<br />&#62; If you use the tray, lift out the glass turntable and rollers and turn off the turntable drive, then place the glass tray in the bottom.<br /><br />GENERAL HINTS ON MICROWAVE COOKING<br />It is largely steam created by the microwaves which does the cooking, so the key to cooking many items (especially vegies) is to generate and hold that steam.<br />&#62; If you are warming bread, wrap it in a towel.  It is astounding how effective a single layer of paper towel can be.  If the bread is rock hard, slightly dampen the towel, and use half-power--the warm bread will be soft and fresh.  Heat only briefly and/or at reduced power.<br />&#62; You can even bake potatoes or roast ears of corn-on-the-cob in a microwave, if you wrap them in a damp cloth towel.<br />&#62; Rinse vegetables before you cook them---that washes off any pesticides etc., and the extra water will produce extra steam.  If the vegies are dehydrated after long storage, you may want to soak them a few hours ahead to time to re-hydrate them.<br />&#62; It is usually best NOT to boil vegies in a container of water in a microwave, because the excess formation of steam LOWERS the cooking temperature.  Your goal should be to create a little steam, contain it, and superheat it.  (This is the same principle as a pressure cooker).<br />&#62; Stir some oil (e.g., olive) oil with cut vegetables---a coating of oil will help hold the steam inside the individual pieces of vegetable.<br />&#62; A selection of glass casseroles of a range of sizes with glass lids can be essential for microwave cooking.  The goal is that the vegies fill the container and the container is covered with a lid---so that the steam is concentrated.  [[ASIN:B001HZY9CM Anchor Hocking 3 PieceCasserole Glass Bakeware Set with Bonus 2 Piece Kitchen Tool Set]]<br />&#62; If you don't have a glass casserole the right size, you can often use a glass or ceramic bowl, and use a saucer or small plate as a lid.<br />&#62; Heating plastic may cause it to de-gas toxic compounds---if you plan to heat left-overs in your microwave, it is best to use glass storage containers [[ASIN:B0000CFTB0 Pyrex 6022369 Storage 14-Piece Round Set, Clear with Blue Lids]].

Because the controls are on the bottom (instead of the side) the door is higher and it easily clears the edge of the sink next to it and, occasionally, drying dishes without having to move anything.<br /><br />Love the sleekness of the look and simplicity of the controls.  Miss the number pad a bit, but knew it didn't have one when I bought it and am quickly adjusting.  Power control and basic instructions on what setting to use have been helpful (couldn't even figure out power setting on previously owned machine!).  Oh and the very short beeps at the end of a cycle are not nearly as annoying as the longer ones on other models I have owned.<br /><br />We typically use for reheating food (single or multiple servings) or beverages and the occasional bowl of popcorn and it heats quite well.  In fact, the popcorn button is the only part I completely dislike, as it is preset for only 1.75 oz bags and cannot be changed.  We gave up preservative laden pre-packaged bags of popcorn years ago in favor of real kernels using a special bowl or paper bag, so the popcorn setting is useless for us.  Have not noticed any difference in heating between this and previous full size model we owned, except that beverages seem to heat faster.  Full sized plates fit and have had no issue with container heights (even my large popcorn bowl fits nicely).<br /><br />Bought the white version online at Home Depot, as their price was actually better than Amazon's and included free delivery as well.

In performance and style, this Whirlpool microwave is absolutely superior. A few notes:<br /><br />- Heats faster and more evenly than I'm used to. Depth is 17 inches, which is one inch larger than my old microwave. Thus, I'm able to use my large square plates in this one.<br /><br />- Install was a bit tricky. I installed in a slot previously occupied by a microwave, so I did not have to cut a vent hole or locate studs. I did have to remove the old mounting plate, which was shorter. This unit came with a cardboard template to locate the bottom line of the mounting plate on the wall. This wall template worked fine - I simply drew the line, then held up the metal plate, and drilled into the studs in the appropriate holes.<br /><br />The top template was a different matter. Whirlpool provides a paper template to affix to the underside of your cabinets to locate the holes to drill for the cabinet mount. If you have a recess under your cabinets, as I do, you will need to trim the template to get it to fit. I did this, and drilled through the template holes. They were about a half inch off. I threw the template away and remeasured, and drilled 9 1/2 from the back wall (not 10 as specified in the installation instructions). These holes worked.<br /><br />The power cord also has to go through the cabinet above. The instructions say to bore a 1.5-inch hole. I did this with a spade bit (enlarging a ~.75 inch hole from the old microwave). Seems a bit large, could probably have gotten away with a 1 inch hole.<br /><br />I have the microwave wall-vented. Installing the flap with sheet metal screws on the microwave and placing into my pre-existing vent hole was easy. I can't speak to the ease of the ceiling vent mount.<br /><br />- There are presets for popcorn, potator, and pizza. Of these, I've only used the pizza setting to reheat a small slice. Took 1 minute 40 seconds on a lower setting,but heated it a bit too hot. Would probably be fine for a large slice.<br /><br />Other than that, it looks and works great.",11/13/2013,0.21612891554832456,"['Bought', 'replace', 'unit', 'came', 'house', 'performance', 'style', 'Whirlpool', 'microwave', 'absolutely', 'superior', 'notes', 'br', 'br', 'Heats', 'faster', 'evenly', 'used', 'Depth', 'inches', 'one', 'inch', 'larger', 'old', 'microwave', 'Thus', 'able', 'use', 'large', 'square', 'plates', 'br', 'br', 'Install', 'bit', 'tricky', 'installed', 'slot', 'previously', 'occupied', 'microwave', 'cut', 'vent', 'hole', 'locate', 'studs', 'remove', 'old', 'mounting', 'plate', 'shorter', 'unit', 'came', 'cardboard', 'template', 'locate', 'bottom', 'line', 'mounting', 'plate', 'wall', 'wall', 'template', 'worked', 'fine', 'simply', 'drew', 'line', 'held', 'metal', 'plate', 'drilled', 'studs', 'appropriate', 'br', 'br', 'top', 'template', 'different', 'matter', 'Whirlpool', 'provides', 'paper', 'template', 'affix', 'underside', 'cabinets', 'locate', 'holes', 'drill', 'cabinet', 'mount', 'recess', 'cabinets', 'need', 'trim', 'template', 'get', 'fit', 'drilled', 'template', 'holes', 'half', 'inch', 'threw', 'template', 'away', 'remeasured', 'drilled', 'back', 'wall', 'specified', 'installation', 'instructions', 'holes', 'br', 'br', 'power', 'cord', 'also', 'go', 'cabinet', 'instructions', 'say', 'bore', 'hole', 'spade', 'bit', 'enlarging', 'inch', 'hole', 'old', 'microwave', 'Seems', 'bit', 'large', 'could', 'probably', 'gotten', 'away', 'inch', 'br', 'br', 'microwave', 'Installing', 'flap', 'sheet', 'metal', 'screws', 'microwave', 'placing', 'vent', 'hole', 'easy', 'ca', 'speak', 'ease', 'ceiling', 'vent', 'br', 'br', 'presets', 'popcorn', 'potator', 'pizza', 'used', 'pizza', 'setting', 'reheat', 'small', 'slice', 'Took', 'minute', 'seconds', 'lower', 'setting', 'heated', 'bit', 'hot', 'Would', 'probably', 'fine', 'large', 'br', 'br', 'looks', 'works', 'great']"

I really liked the Samsung looks and the price compared to the other big brands was enticing but I read tons of negative reviews and held off on buying it.  A few weeks later I see it on sale from its already great price and bought it $230.  It sticks out about an inch more beyond my cabinets than the ge did but I think this is intentional as the exhaust vent blows out of the top toward the front of the unit.  This actually provides better coverage when cooking on the stove top as well since everything rises right up into the vent hood.  It's been a year and a half and it still works great.  It's just as powerful as the ge was so either it's under rated or the ge was over rated in wattage.  For under 300 bucks you can't go wrong with this microwave.  The stainless doesn't mark up with smudges as easy as my other appliances and it has just as many features as the more expensive ones.  It's controls are lot easier to use than the touch screen was on my ge.  Fyi don't get a touch screen appliance!!  I like the 4 fan speeds.

It was fairly inexpensive and looks good in the kitchen.  Observations in no particular order:<br /><br />1. The sensor cooking on this is much better than on our old Sharp countertop unit, which overcooked everything.  I had thought at the time that it would be nice if there was a way to calibrate the sensor.  While the Samsung doesn't give you calibration options, it does let you say what you are cooking, and apparently adjusts its response to the sensor accordingly.  I have found that it works pretty well to always tell it I'm reheating pasta!<br /><br />2. A general-use kitchen timer is provided.  Of course most microwaves do, so that's not unusual, but this one is smarter than some.  It is able to function independently of the cooking timer.  For example, if you are timing something for 30 minutes, then decide partway through you want to heat a cup of water for one minute, it will correctly keep track of the 30 minute timer in the background and display it again after it's done with the water.<br /><br />3. Minor niggle: the oven vent is supposed to come on whenever it detects heat rising from below, but ours seems to always need to be turned on manually.<br /><br />4. This is where the Samsung loses a review star.  The Eco Mode feature is poorly conceived.  When you press the button, the panel lights go out and standby power consumption is reduced.  So far, so good.  But then as as soon as you use the microwave again, or even just open the door, or use the oven light or vent options, it leaves eco mode; the display comes back on and STAYS on.  It really should remember eco as a user preference rather than as a temporary mode.  I also suspect this ties in to the problems some customers have had with the control panel failing.  If we were allowed to set a persistent eco mode, it's likely that the front panel would be mostly-off except when in actual operation, and as a result it might not burn out.  We have made it a habit to push the eco button after each use.<br /><br />In sum, it fits with our kitchen decor and cooks well, and we hope we will be able to make it last a long time by remembering the eco button as often as possible.",10/12/2013,0.8157137632369995,"['installed', 'Electrolux', 'oven', 'provides', 'venting', 'LED', 'lights', 'addition', 'primary', 'microwave', 'functions', 'fairly', 'inexpensive', 'looks', 'good', 'kitchen', 'Observations', 'particular', 'order', 'br', 'br', 'sensor', 'cooking', 'much', 'better', 'old', 'Sharp', 'countertop', 'unit', 'overcooked', 'everything', 'thought', 'time', 'would', 'nice', 'way', 'calibrate', 'sensor', 'Samsung', 'give', 'calibration', 'options', 'let', 'say', 'cooking', 'apparently', 'adjusts', 'response', 'sensor', 'accordingly', 'found', 'works', 'pretty', 'well', 'always', 'tell', 'reheating', 'pasta', 'br', 'br', 'kitchen', 'timer', 'provided', 'course', 'microwaves', 'unusual', 'one', 'smarter', 'able', 'function', 'independently', 'cooking', 'timer', 'example', 'timing', 'something', 'minutes', 'decide', 'partway', 'want', 'heat', 'cup', 'water', 'one', 'minute', 'correctly', 'keep', 'track', 'minute', 'timer', 'background', 'display', 'done', 'br', 'br', 'Minor', 'niggle', 'oven', 'vent', 'supposed', 'come', 'whenever', 'detects', 'heat', 'rising', 'seems', 'always', 'need', 'turned', 'br', 'br', 'Samsung', 'loses', 'review', 'star', 'Eco', 'Mode', 'feature', 'poorly', 'conceived', 'press', 'button', 'panel', 'lights', 'go', 'standby', 'power', 'consumption', 'reduced', 'far', 'good', 'soon', 'use', 'microwave', 'even', 'open', 'door', 'use', 'oven', 'light', 'vent', 'options', 'leaves', 'eco', 'mode', 'display', 'comes', 'back', 'STAYS', 'really', 'remember', 'eco', 'user', 'preference', 'rather', 'temporary', 'mode', 'also', 'suspect', 'ties', 'problems', 'customers', 'control', 'panel', 'failing', 'allowed', 'set', 'persistent', 'eco', 'mode', 'likely', 'front', 'panel', 'would', 'except', 'actual', 'operation', 'result', 'might', 'burn', 'made', 'habit', 'push', 'eco', 'button', 'br', 'br', 'sum', 'fits', 'kitchen', 'decor', 'cooks', 'well', 'hope', 'able', 'make', 'last', 'long', 'time', 'remembering', 'eco', 'button', 'often', 'possible']"

I can almost fit my pinky finger into the gap that has formed between the door and the glass. The microwave is used maybe once a week for a reheat after a late shift. When I called Sharp about this issue, I was transferred to every department until finally the one I needed was closed. Yep transferred to different departments only to be told that they couldn't help and the one that could help me was closed for the evening. I called at 1pm MST. This is so frustrating to have my beautiful dream kitchen with this eyesore coming apart...who knows how they will have to rip it out.

Some changes necessary for mounting, fortunately, the exhaust duct was in the same position as the older unit and installation took about 1 hour. Love the larger cavity size and rotating table. Helps to warm foods more evenly when using microwave. Works wonderfully as microwave and as convection oven. Saves us energy by allowing us to bake many foods without having to use our stove's larger gas oven and it works quickly. Only two &#34;observations&#34; we have are: 1. Touch Pad is very difficult to see in normal light. Attractive design, but near impossible to read as the gray typeface on black background is horrible choice. Not a big change for GE to make, surprised that engineering has not yet ordered such an important and easy revision. This may well be a safety and/or frustrating issue for some persons. See the labels I ended up making for the touch pad. (See Photo) 2. The volume of the beeper (at loudest) is barely audible.  Other than the above two &#34;cons&#34; we are very happy with the purchase. Good value!  Update May 2016 - First time we used the convection heater at 400 degrees, after about 5 minutes, the oven died - was as if a fuse had blown - Ge service arrived the following day to diagnose the problem, a blown thermostat.

Amazon was as always good on making full refund on its return.

It looks like a professional food service microwave. To me, the stainless steel interior is easier to clean than a white painted one.<br /><br />We have heard that microwave ovens don't last like they used to (we have one low quality unbranded OTR one in a mobile home at the moment which was new in 1995 & still working as well as it ever did, and another LG 900 watt in an RV from 2004, also a good runner at this writing, July 2013).<br /><br />We didn't want to spend a lot of money if the microwave was only going to last a couple of years. Well, with this Danby, we have a two year replacement warranty. If it dies before its time, we either get a new one or a refund of the money we spent on this one. Fair enough, I thought.<br /><br />There are not a lot of features here and it isn't super powerful. Certainly adequate but our LG 900 watt heats things up a bit faster and has more useful programs like casserole re-heat with 4 levels and programs for either fresh or frozen vegetables with different quantities.<br /><br />The Danby reheat button has only 3 minutes; no other options. For most cooking/reheating you have to punch in the time you guess is about right manually.<br /><br />Considering the price ($100 Canadian plus sales tax) and the two year replacement warranty ($10 from Wal Mart), we are pretty well pleased with this so far. We have never had a countertop microwave as big as this one so we had to get used to all the acreage it takes up.

I just love how it looks in the corner of my kitchen. The only negative to me is that it's kind of expensive for a small microwave, but what was the last thing you bought for your kitchen that just made you happy? Since the only con I can think of is the price, I'll just run through the pros as I see them.<br />1. It's unique. Every other microwave I've ever seen (with the exception of the Sharp Half-Pint) looks pretty much the same: a horizontal rectangle with a door and a keypad control panel to the right. The bottom controls and lack of numeric pad make this thing look entirely different, and in a good way. (Don't worry about the lack of a keypad, the controls are a no-brainer.) When you unbox it and see the rounded back, you know you've bought something different from the norm.<br />2. It's big inside. Bigger than my old GE compact for round things, and I've just never had the urge to throw a 9x13 pan in my microwave. (I have yet to try it with popcorn, manual says limit it to the 1.75 ounce size.)<br />3. It's powerful. 1:30 on high heats up a cup of water better than my old one. Good enough for me.<br />4. The LED display is blue. Very cool, in my opinion.<br />5. The interior light goes on when you open the door. Some small microwaves only light up while you're cooking.<br />6. You can use the timer and cook simultaneously. Pretty standard, but some don't. Also, you can adjust the timer and the cook time on the fly by hitting + or -, no need to stop and reset. And you can toggle between the timer and the clock if you want.<br />7. No door release button. You just grab the recessed edge of the door and pull. And it feels solid when you shut it.<br />8. The reminder tone shuts off. Yes, it reminds you when you forget to pull something out, but it shuts up after three reminders and reverts to the clock. (I swear my old microwave displayed End most of the time.)<br />9. Limited features.The only special features are defrost, reheat, popcorn, and power level (100%, 75%, 50%, 25%, and the power-saving 0%). I've never used anything more.<br />10. I'm running out of ideas, but to make a nice round 10, I'll point out that the door is about two inches thick with a space between an inner and outer window. This gives it a kind of window-box look that I like a lot.<br />Hope this helps convince everybody to pull the trigger and buy this microwave. You won't regret it!<br />NOTE: The display panel comes covered in a clear plastic film that is pretty easy to miss when you're unpacking. I didn't see it and was highly alarmed after a couple of days when the start button started to look and feel cracked! Further investigation revealed the protective film, which easily peeled off to reveal a pristine panel underneath.",7/3/2013,0.7935494184494019,"['got', 'microwave', 'yesterday', 'smiling', 'ever', 'since', 'love', 'looks', 'corner', 'kitchen', 'negative', 'kind', 'expensive', 'small', 'microwave', 'last', 'thing', 'bought', 'kitchen', 'made', 'happy', 'Since', 'con', 'think', 'price', 'run', 'pros', 'see', 'br', 'unique', 'Every', 'microwave', 'ever', 'seen', 'exception', 'Sharp', 'looks', 'pretty', 'much', 'horizontal', 'rectangle', 'door', 'keypad', 'control', 'panel', 'right', 'bottom', 'controls', 'lack', 'numeric', 'pad', 'make', 'thing', 'look', 'entirely', 'different', 'good', 'way', 'worry', 'lack', 'keypad', 'controls', 'unbox', 'see', 'rounded', 'back', 'know', 'bought', 'something', 'different', 'br', 'big', 'inside', 'Bigger', 'old', 'GE', 'compact', 'round', 'things', 'never', 'urge', 'throw', 'pan', 'microwave', 'yet', 'try', 'popcorn', 'manual', 'says', 'limit', 'ounce', 'size', 'br', 'powerful', 'high', 'heats', 'cup', 'water', 'better', 'old', 'one', 'Good', 'enough', 'br', 'LED', 'display', 'blue', 'cool', 'br', 'interior', 'light', 'goes', 'open', 'door', 'small', 'microwaves', 'light', 'br', 'use', 'timer', 'cook', 'simultaneously', 'Pretty', 'standard', 'Also', 'adjust', 'timer', 'cook', 'time', 'fly', 'hitting', 'need', 'stop', 'reset', 'toggle', 'timer', 'clock', 'br', 'door', 'release', 'button', 'grab', 'recessed', 'edge', 'door', 'pull', 'feels', 'solid', 'shut', 'br', 'reminder', 'tone', 'shuts', 'Yes', 'reminds', 'forget', 'pull', 'something', 'shuts', 'three', 'reminders', 'reverts', 'clock', 'swear', 'old', 'microwave', 'displayed', 'End', 'time', 'br', 'Limited', 'special', 'features', 'defrost', 'reheat', 'popcorn', 'power', 'level', 'never', 'used', 'anything', 'br', 'running', 'ideas', 'make', 'nice', 'round', 'point', 'door', 'two', 'inches', 'thick', 'space', 'inner', 'outer', 'window', 'gives', 'kind', 'look', 'like', 'br', 'Hope', 'helps', 'convince', 'everybody', 'pull', 'trigger', 'buy', 'microwave', 'wo', 'regret', 'br', 'NOTE', 'display', 'panel', 'comes', 'covered', 'clear', 'plastic', 'film', 'pretty', 'easy', 'miss', 'unpacking', 'see', 'highly', 'alarmed', 'couple', 'days', 'start', 'button', 'started', 'look', 'feel', 'cracked', 'investigation', 'revealed', 'protective', 'film', 'easily', 'peeled', 'reveal', 'pristine', 'panel', 'underneath']"

There was no need for the industry to completely change size standards for countertop models.<br /><br />That said, I've only had this microwave a few weeks; so far so good.  I like its features and performance.  It's a bit smaller inside than our previous full size GE microwave.  The previous GE fit perfectly in our microwave cabinet, but its magnetron went out in a scary way after about 6 years of use.<br /><br />So far, only drawback to new microwave is that the instructions say to keep the front of the microwave 3 inches back from edge of countertop so it won't tip over when the door is open.  Not enough space to do that in our built-in microwave cabinet, so have to be careful not to inadvertently put weight on the open door (with my hand), or the whole appliance starts to tip forward.

Some SS Steel parts magnetic.,"I just installed this item. Be careful with the lag screws provided. They are tin like and do strip out no matter what and cannot be loosened or tightened once the head strips. They require a special flat nose phillips head but that did not help. Buy some quality mounting screws as $ 500.00+ is not enough for GE to include those, and I hope the rest of the unit is not as cheap as the mounting screws. Pollute the planet and make a extra trip to the hardware store. Second, I was leveling the microwave and son of a gun, the magnet on my level stuck to the inside of the unit, which is supposed to be stainless steel. I would still prefer whatever this stuff is to the plastic interior that comes with non-convection. The templates were perfect and put all the screws in the correct locations. You need to order the charcoal filter if you are using the recirculate rather than outside vented feature. To recirculate, you must unscrew 3 screws on top rear and rotate the fan housing 90 degrees before you install the unit. You also need to remove 2 screws on the upper front trim and slide in the filter then replace the trim. My 15 year old did both. You need to butt the top of the unit to the shelf above, or insert trim pieces around the top. If you don't, and let it hang even 1/2 inch, the unit can rise up if hit and fall off the shallow rear flanges that hold it to the back wall bracket and fall onto the new matching GE range. Our cabinets had a wierd from the 1960's lip on one side (I like old school stuff) and I needed to add the trim to prevent falling. The unit powered on and worked once we finished. Will update after a few months of use. I am a licensed electrical and general contractor, so I hope this helps in getting it ready to install. Took my son and I about an hour. The unit looks great in the kitchen. After months of research, it was between this and the Sharp, but this had more power and capacity, and there was not a Sharp in any showroom for QC comparison.

I will say the microwave works well as far as successfully heating items as a microwave should. Other than that, I find it to be an awkward design in the following ways:<br /><br />- The button for the light is directly under the &#34;Start&#34; button. If you hit the &#34;Start&#34; button, it automatically starts microwaving for 30 seconds. However, in a dimly-lit room, I often accidentally hit the &#34;Start&#34; button when I'm just trying to turn the light on. I can' tell you how many times I have started a 30-second microwave cycle on an empty microwave.<br />- Speaking of the lights there are two light bulbs underneath, which is fine. However, in the one year we've been using this microwave, the same bulb has burned out twice, while the other has yet to burn out at all. The first time, we had to scour the internet for a replacement bulb only to find that the specific wattage of the bulb that came in the microwave is pretty much unavailable. Anywhere. So we did some reading and learned to use a slightly lower wattage bulb. This took entirely too much research and hunting for what should have been a simple light bulb.<br />- The beeping at the end of the cooking (or timer) is quite obnoxious. It's 3 long, loud beeps, and, unlike every other microwave I've ever used, it does NOT stop when you open the microwave door! I have young children and often stand directly in front of the microwave, waiting for the timer to hit 1 second so I can stop it before it beeps so it doesn't wake up anyone sleeping/napping.<br />- There are lots of &#34;convenience&#34; setting (quick buttons), but I have never used a single one of them.

Pros:  a major consumer magazine rates Whirlpool tops in reliability.  At its price this is, as expected, a pretty basic microwave, but fulfills our needs.  It heats well, is (in black) quite attractive, the microwave and fan are quiet, controls are convenient for basic operations.  Cons:  one of the installation templates is printed on the cardboard packaging, the edges of which shred when cut, making the template difficult to use accurately.  The bolts supplied will not work in a deep cabinet and it took trips to four hardware stores to find longer replacements.  The instructions did not include an option to hardwire the electrical connection, so I had to swallow hard and cut the cord without knowing what I'd find once I had (turned out not to be a problem).  I exhausted through the wall, but there's an outlet for internal exhaust, and it opens upwards towards the ceiling.  And I mean OPENS.  There's no grid to keep small objects from falling into the body of the microwave from the cabinet above.  This is atrocious design!  I used some semi-rigid plastic screen and clear silicone sealant to protect this area.  The user instructions which come with the oven are totally inadequate, and Whirlpool's website doesn't seem to have any more.  Just as an example, it says to touch COOK, enter the number code of food item, enter quantiy, then touch the Start control.  But there's no list of food item codes.  I'd still recommend the microwave for those who are willing to deal with these issues.<br /><br />Update:  I contacted Whirlpool:  It turns out the food item codes are behind the door.

I brought it home, removed the older microwave this was replacing and installed this new one, myself. (Installation was a bit more difficult than I expected it to be, but this had more to do with the shoddy installation of the unit it was replacing than any flaws in this unit, so I won't count that as a strike against this product.)<br /><br />In the few months that we have been using this unit, there are several things that I've noticed that have made me regret this purchase:<br /><br />1. The glass plate split in two after about two weeks of use. I have no idea why this occured. My wife stuck in a bowl of oatmeal to cook it and after about 30 seconds there was a loud bang and she turned it off to see what had happened. The glass plate was spilt into two pieces, nearly right down the middle. Weird. The replacement part cost me another $30. Not happy about this!<br /><br />2. The venting fan has a flap that opens to the duct inside the wall. The hinge on this flap is very weak and we can hear it flapping about on windy days. This seems very irregular, as the kitchen wall this unit is mounted on is an inside wall, not an exterior wall, and the ductwork goes up through the roof, not to the nearest exterior wall. I really don't think it should do this. The last unit did not do this, and it's a bit irritating to hear this flap rattling and squeaking around on windy days.<br /><br />3. This microwave positively will not cook a good bag of microwave popping corn. What's up with that? Isn't that a basic necessity of EVERY microwave? Put in a bag of popping corn and you either get 25% of it popped with wet, greasy kernels or 75% popped and it's all burned brown and stinky. The first few times I figured my wife was losing her mind and just counldn't figure out the new unit. Well, I have now tried four different brands of popping corn and got the same results with all brands. For a family that really enjoys microwave popping corn, this was a real bummer, and the number one reason I would never recommend this microwave to another person.<br /><br />4. In general terms, this microwave seems underpowered. It claims to have the same wattage cooking power as the model it replaced, but I'm not seeing it. Everything takes longer to cook with this unit. Sure, in microwave terms, you're only talking about 15% longer cook times which equal out to mere seconds or a few more minutes, so it's not a lot of extra time, but it's just worse than I expected. You always kind of assume that the new model will be better than the old, but that just wasn't the case, in this instance.<br /><br />5. OK, this one is just personal preference and not really a problem with the unit. (I probably should have inquired about this feature before purchasing this product.) I prefer microwaves that you just pop food into, press the seconds (or minutes) you want to cook something and then press start. On this unit, you need to press a button marked cook time before you start pressing any numbers. If you press any number at the start, the unit powers up and begins cooking the food by the number of minutes assigned to that number button on the number pad. Some people may be used to this types of microwave. I am not, so I prefer the aforementioned method of cooking food. I don't need auto-programmed cook times assigned to my numbers.<br /><br />Overall, generally displeased with this model and would NEVER recommend it to anyone.e results with all brands.

We got this microwave because it fit in with our stainless steel appliances after we redid our kitchen. It's actually a great microwave, I think, it looks great and the settings/features are really nice. But, a little bit after the 1-year warranty ran out, part of the keypad became defective--the numbers. Some of the other buttons worked so we could still partly use it while we diddled around before finally calling the repair technician. He came out, took one look at it and told us that it would be more expensive to repair it than to just buy a new one. Called and complained to GE, and we were able to score a GE credit worth almost the price of another microwave. We had specific space/look criteria, so we had to end up buying the same one. It's only a matter of time before it goes, too.<br /><br />To add another note, my college apartment has the exact same microwave, only in white instead of stainless steel. The keypad also broke one day, and when I called to get it fixed they came out the next day and replaced the whole thing--apparently it happens so often they have a few of them just sitting around as replacements.<br /><br />I'm giving it 2 stars because, while it is prone to breaking, it is at least a really functional/attractive microwave and we didn't have to pay very much on a replacement.

Needs a recall, but Whirlpool does not care.","This microwave was selected during a KB HOME build for our new home over 2 years ago (Summer 2010).  The microwave indicated that it was manufactured in April 2010.  Low and behold the microwave would start shutting down by itself when I hit start beginning about June 2012.  A few days ago it just stopped working completely.  No pop, no fizzle, no crackle - it just wouldn't heat up anything.  Whirlpool dispatched a 3rd-party repair person and he stated that the magnetron was bad (or dead?).  He was fairly certain it was a recall item.  The repair person estimated that, absent a recall, it would cost $450 to fix. The service appointment itself was $89.  The following day, the repair service left a voice-mail stating that it was not a recall item, but that I should verify it with Whirlpool .<br /><br />I contacted Whirlpool (1-800-253-1301) and the customer service rep stated that it wasn't their problem once the standard 12-month warranty had elapsed.  The rep said there was no recall for the magnetron.  I escalated the matter to a supervisor.  All the supervisor did was reiterate that Whirlpool wasn't going to do anything past the 12-months.  The supervisor then offered to sell me one of four new microwaves at a VIP rate.  Of course the rate was not VIP at all once you added the deliver ($70) and the installation ($45) charges (so for being screwed over, I was a VIP?).  It goes without saying that I didn't take her up on the offer(s).<br /><br />Needless to say, I was very upset and immediately Google'd the model number in the hope of finding out more info on the problem and perhaps locating a cheaper replacement for the microwave.  And that, my friends, is how I ended up here on Amazon and saw that 29 other reviewers before me also had issues with this particular microwave.  I got a certified lemon.<br /><br />What are my options at this point?  A class action lawsuit?  A complaint to the state Attorney General's office? I don't know. What I do know is that Whirlpool is aware of the problem and could not care less.

A bit difficult to install.","Our over the range microwave died suddenly in our new home.  I was not the original purchase of this particular appliance, and it was over 10 years old.<br /><br />So I began looking for product replacement.  I found a Whirlpool model online that had some nice ratings, but when I went to my local big box store to purchase, they didn't have the exact Whirlpool model I had read about.  What I found, was this model, which I assume is the newest version.<br /><br />The microwave has a very nice finish.  The door and front feel fairly sturdy.<br /><br />Operation is simple.  I tend to hate overly complex controls.  I want power and simple controls.  This microwave meets my needs in this regard.  This microwave has lots of power.<br /><br />Now the bad.  The install.  This is my second microwave install.  My first being a retrofit of an over the range fan.<br /><br />My first install, and noticing the hardware of my current broken microwave.  The units are mounted by a rear wall bracket that holds the bottom part of the microwave.  And the top of the microwave is held by a couple of suspension bolts fixed to the cabinet.  The USUAL location of these bolts are the two front corners of the microwave.<br /><br />The rear bracket is usually the same size/shape as the rear of the microwave.  This makes it fairly easy to just place the bracket on the rear wall and push up until the bracket touches the cabinet.  No measurement really necessary.  This Microwave has a small bar hanger.  So you'll need to be very accurate with a measuring tape to figure out where the bottom of the Microwave will sit against the wall.<br /><br />I tend to not trust myself in this regard.  So I taped the bracket to the bottom of the microwave.  Held the microwave up against the wall, and had a helper draw a marking line with a pencil.<br /><br />The second negative.  Usually the suspension bolts are at the front corners of the microwave.  In mounting position, my current defective microwave has boltsin the corners.  I could have taken the other microwave from my other house and I suspect the holes are in the same position.<br /><br />On this microwave, one bolt is about 3 inches in from the edge (which is slightly offset).  The second bolt is about 7 inches in so it is offset quite a bit.  Both holes did not line up with my current microwave mounting holes.  So to mount this microwave I had to drill new holes in my cabinet.<br /><br />So take this into consideration.  I bought my unit as a floor model return.  I suspect it was returned for this very reason.<br /><br />Otherwise I've been happy with this purchase so far.",11/4/2012,0.5,"['range', 'microwave', 'died', 'suddenly', 'new', 'home', 'original', 'purchase', 'particular', 'appliance', 'years', 'br', 'br', 'began', 'looking', 'product', 'replacement', 'found', 'Whirlpool', 'model', 'online', 'nice', 'ratings', 'went', 'local', 'big', 'box', 'store', 'purchase', 'exact', 'Whirlpool', 'model', 'read', 'found', 'model', 'assume', 'newest', 'br', 'br', 'microwave', 'nice', 'finish', 'door', 'front', 'feel', 'fairly', 'br', 'br', 'Operation', 'simple', 'tend', 'hate', 'overly', 'complex', 'controls', 'want', 'power', 'simple', 'controls', 'microwave', 'meets', 'needs', 'regard', 'microwave', 'lots', 'br', 'br', 'bad', 'install', 'second', 'microwave', 'install', 'first', 'retrofit', 'range', 'br', 'br', 'first', 'install', 'noticing', 'hardware', 'current', 'broken', 'microwave', 'units', 'mounted', 'rear', 'wall', 'bracket', 'holds', 'bottom', 'part', 'microwave', 'top', 'microwave', 'held', 'couple', 'suspension', 'bolts', 'fixed', 'cabinet', 'USUAL', 'location', 'bolts', 'two', 'front', 'corners', 'br', 'br', 'rear', 'bracket', 'usually', 'rear', 'microwave', 'makes', 'fairly', 'easy', 'place', 'bracket', 'rear', 'wall', 'push', 'bracket', 'touches', 'cabinet', 'measurement', 'really', 'necessary', 'Microwave', 'small', 'bar', 'hanger', 'need', 'accurate', 'measuring', 'tape', 'figure', 'bottom', 'Microwave', 'sit', 'br', 'br', 'tend', 'trust', 'regard', 'taped', 'bracket', 'bottom', 'microwave', 'Held', 'microwave', 'wall', 'helper', 'draw', 'marking', 'line', 'br', 'br', 'second', 'negative', 'Usually', 'suspension', 'bolts', 'front', 'corners', 'microwave', 'mounting', 'position', 'current', 'defective', 'microwave', 'boltsin', 'corners', 'could', 'taken', 'microwave', 'house', 'suspect', 'holes', 'br', 'br', 'microwave', 'one', 'bolt', 'inches', 'edge', 'slightly', 'offset', 'second', 'bolt', 'inches', 'offset', 'quite', 'bit', 'holes', 'line', 'current', 'microwave', 'mounting', 'holes', 'mount', 'microwave', 'drill', 'new', 'holes', 'br', 'br', 'take', 'consideration', 'bought', 'unit', 'floor', 'model', 'return', 'suspect', 'returned', 'br', 'br', 'Otherwise', 'happy', 'purchase', 'far']"

In May I noticed that when I opened the door of the microwave it appeared to have a short (a bright light flashed then went out).  It still heated but as I thought it might be a fire hazard I contacted Samsung.  They set me up with a service repair company that had a poor rating on Angie's list.  A guy came out, dismantled it and said a key part needed to be replaced (he noted 'switches' on the service order dated May 15th).  He said it would take 3-5 days so he came back a week later, without the part, saying he just need to tighten some wires.  It worked for a few weeks, then started to heat only intermittently.  Called the service company again, and a guy came out and jiggled the door, saying there was a problem with the switches, but that they didn't need to be replaced.  It worked again for a few weeks, where I had to keep jiggling the door, and finally stopped heating altogether.  Now, knowing that there was a problem with the switches, I expected the guy to arrive with the needed part.  He came but again, no part, saying he just wanted to confirm it was the switches and that the part had already been ordered.  After not hearing anything for a few weeks, I called back and was told that 'Sharp parts were backordered'.  When I told her it was a Samsung, she didn't look up my order but just said she would look into it and call me back.  After not hearing anything again, I called back and she said the same thing (Sharp is back-ordered, correction it's Samsung)and said she would call me back.  Again didn't hear back so called Samsung.  The escalation department reviewed the situation and I was put in for an exchange because the process had gone on so long.  She said I would get a call from someone who would review options with me (when I asked what the options would be she didn't know--why is that?).

Installation: Problematic.,"I had an older GE microwave above my range that died after about 8 years. When looking for a replacement I decided to go for another similar GE in order to swap it out easily, figuring it would use similar hardware. That was my first mistake.<br /><br />There's a steel plate used to mount the oven on the wall plus three big screws that go in from the cabinet on top. Not only is the plate different (requiring removal of old & installation of the new), not only are the anchor points in different places (requiring new holes), but they're placed just marginally off the old anchor points. Meaning that the integrity of the wood where you need to drill is compromised from the old screw holes. It required me to install a whole new shelf in the upper cabinet as well as trying my best to fill the old stud holes with wood filler and hoping it would be strong enough when I re-drilled.<br /><br />Here's the kicker... the installation hardware comes with butterfly screws as well as two thick wood screws for mounting to the wall studs. Unfortunately, those two wood screws are made of very cheap & weak metal. I pre-drilled guide holes as per the instructions, but when it came to screwing the screws in- the heads twisted right off on both of them (and I was extra careful with the second one after the first one broke).  The screws were already 3/4 of the way in, leaving me with no way to remove them and blocking the ability to try again in the same spot (a spot required for proper installation).  The oven isn't light, the installation requires heavy duty hardware, why ship the microwave with such crappy screws?<br /><br />Lessons:<br /><br />Buy your own mounting hardware.<br />When it comes to buying a replacement appliance, there's no value in nepotism.",6/18/2012,0.18264469504356384,"['older', 'GE', 'microwave', 'range', 'died', 'years', 'looking', 'replacement', 'decided', 'go', 'another', 'similar', 'GE', 'order', 'swap', 'easily', 'figuring', 'would', 'use', 'similar', 'hardware', 'first', 'br', 'br', 'steel', 'plate', 'used', 'mount', 'oven', 'wall', 'plus', 'three', 'big', 'screws', 'go', 'cabinet', 'top', 'plate', 'different', 'requiring', 'removal', 'old', 'installation', 'new', 'anchor', 'points', 'different', 'places', 'requiring', 'new', 'holes', 'placed', 'marginally', 'old', 'anchor', 'points', 'Meaning', 'integrity', 'wood', 'need', 'drill', 'compromised', 'old', 'screw', 'holes', 'required', 'install', 'whole', 'new', 'shelf', 'upper', 'cabinet', 'well', 'trying', 'best', 'fill', 'old', 'stud', 'holes', 'wood', 'filler', 'hoping', 'would', 'strong', 'enough', 'br', 'br', 'kicker', 'installation', 'hardware', 'comes', 'butterfly', 'screws', 'well', 'two', 'thick', 'wood', 'screws', 'mounting', 'wall', 'studs', 'Unfortunately', 'two', 'wood', 'screws', 'made', 'cheap', 'weak', 'metal', 'guide', 'holes', 'per', 'instructions', 'came', 'screwing', 'screws', 'heads', 'twisted', 'right', 'extra', 'careful', 'second', 'one', 'first', 'one', 'broke', 'screws', 'already', 'way', 'leaving', 'way', 'remove', 'blocking', 'ability', 'try', 'spot', 'spot', 'required', 'proper', 'installation', 'oven', 'light', 'installation', 'requires', 'heavy', 'duty', 'hardware', 'ship', 'microwave', 'crappy', 'screws', 'br', 'br', 'Lessons', 'br', 'br', 'Buy', 'mounting', 'br', 'comes', 'buying', 'replacement', 'appliance', 'value', 'nepotism']"

At no point did they tell me what this service call would cost.  So I had to call back and get a customer service rep who told me it would be $129 for someone to come out to my home.  That of course does not include any parts or replacement.  I can buy a brand new microwave that works from a better company for twice that.  Why would I fix a microwave that broke in a little over a year of use.  In all my years of microwave use, I have never had a microwave break.  It's pretty ridiculous to me to have it break in a little over a year, especially when my neighbor had hers break two months prior.  I would never buy a Whirlpool appliance again.",5/5/2012,0.1375550925731659,"['microwave', 'installed', 'builder', 'new', 'home', 'year', 'half', 'ago', 'sure', 'since', 'found', 'service', 'technician', 'area', 'numerous', 'times', 'replace', 'microwaves', 'died', 'months', 'regular', 'use', 'run', 'heat', 'anything', 'called', 'Whirlpool', 'troubleshoot', 'put', 'automated', 'call', 'set', 'service', 'appointment', 'point', 'tell', 'service', 'call', 'would', 'cost', 'call', 'back', 'get', 'customer', 'service', 'rep', 'told', 'would', 'someone', 'come', 'home', 'course', 'include', 'parts', 'replacement', 'buy', 'brand', 'new', 'microwave', 'works', 'better', 'company', 'twice', 'would', 'fix', 'microwave', 'broke', 'little', 'year', 'use', 'years', 'microwave', 'use', 'never', 'microwave', 'break', 'pretty', 'ridiculous', 'break', 'little', 'year', 'especially', 'neighbor', 'break', 'two', 'months', 'prior', 'would', 'never', 'buy', 'Whirlpool', 'appliance']"

Apparently From The  Manufacture GE,"Purchased this product from Warehouse Deals (Fulfilled by Amazon) which was advertised as USED but in GOOD condition, microwave oven arrived April 28, 2012. The product did not work and the door was damaged. Contacted GE Tech support who dispatched a repair tech to my home on May 1, 2012, who indicated the door was bent and the microwave had internal damage. He also stated he would ship the parts to my home and when they arrived to call GE for him to return. On May 5, 2012 the parts arrived, notified GE immediately and a tech representative  would be responding Monday May 7, 2012. I don't know if this product  had damage before it was shipped by Warehouse Deals or it was destroyed in transit by UPS. I will keep this situation updated as time progresses then either keep the rating or change it? Just a note...reading all the bad reviews on this particular GE Profile Spacemaker microwave oven (PEM31SMSS) I'm contemplating  having additional problems with this particular GE microwave. I really had no choice, this unit replaced my old GE Profile Spacemaker microwave (JEM31SF01) that was built into a custom kitchen cabinet; as I required the exact dimensions/screw lineup for the interior metal holding frame and the stainless steel trim covers.<br /><br />Update 5/9/12: The GE technical representative responded to my residence Monday 5/7/2012 who subsequently replaced the front door and some internal electronic parts. The new door still did not align properly with the frame. The rep contacted GE and informed them of the continuous failure of the door not to align correctly. A decision was made to replace the entire unit with a new replacement. I will keep this situation updated if and when the new microwave arrives from GE.<br /><br />Update: 5/17/12: A brand new microwave was delivered to my home and installed by a installation/repair company sub-contracted by GE. One of the installers from this third party company advised me this specific GE Profile Spacemaker microwave oven (PEM31SMSS) is their #1 problematic GE microwave; for the reason that the inside paint peels-off within 3 to 6 months of use. The gentleman also indicated they exchange these microwave's more than any other GE microwave. With all this latest documentation and all the negative reviews on this particular model (PEM31SMSS) what's the probability of my new microwave lasting the test of time???..... Mediocre To Put It Mildly. As I previously indicated, I had no recourse, since I needed a replacement to fit into a custom cabinet, with the correct dimensions/screw lineup for the interior metal holding frame and the stainless steel trim covers; these two items cost more than the entire microwave alone. In conclusion, I would recommend everyone to purchase a different model GE or a different brand all together.oven (PEM31SMSS) is their #1 problematic GE microwave; for the reason that the inside paint peels-off within 3 to 6 months of use.

Most people who write appliance reviews do so because their apppliance stopped working and they get mad and want to take it out on the company.<br /><br />The Problem:  most microwaves are made by a few Asian companies.  GE has stopped manufacturing most small appliances and even some major appliances.  Many of the GE refridgerators are not only made in Korea, they were designed and engineered by Korea and only have a GE label slapped on them.  The expensive GE Profile microwaves are made by the guys who make the Panasonic and other microwaves.<br /><br />With an appliance or piece of electronics, it can be the luck of the draw.  There is a basic reliablity curve, called the bathtup curve. In the first few months of a product's life, there is a high percentage of units that fail.  Then, if you get past that, there is a long period where the odds of your product failing is very low, until end of life is reached, maybe 10 to 20 years later.  The people who write reviews in Amazon are the unfortunate ones who products fail during that initial period.<br /><br />My microwave broke after 4 months.  But, GE customer service is great.  I called them up.  They came to my house the same day.  It needed parts the repair did not have on his truck.  He ordered the parts, which came 2 days later.  I made another appointment and my microwave was back in a week.<br /><br />This microwave is big inside.  I don't know how imporantant that is.  We can put big plates or platters in it.  But, if it wasn't so big, I could just put the food in smaller bowl.<br /><br />It has lots of heating options.  But, so do the cheapest microwaves.  Personally, I don't think any of those heating options are of any value.  It is not like they are reliable to work automatically.  With any microwave, you experiment a couple of times and then you konw what setting to use.<br /><br />Really, there are only 3 important features for amicrowave:<br /><br />1.  How it looks.  I think this looks great.<br /><br />2.  Power.  This is 1200 watts and heats food fast.  I wouldn't get anything under 1000 watts.<br /><br />3.  Quality.

I selected it mainly due to the price (less than 60 bucks at walmart) and the fact that it takes up little counter space. Although I was not expecting much in terms of features, I've been really impressed with this.<br /><br />It offers a wide range of programming features. There are 6 one-touch buttons so you can set 1 to 6 minutes of cooking time with one key press. It also has an add 30 seconds feature that can be used at start-up or while the microwave is already running. There are also a host of timing options for cooking and defrosting.<br /><br />It looks really nice - much better than I was expecting. Pretty decent stainless steel trim on the front and the handle, and a black casing. Looks like it cost a lot more. Easy to clean, and the handle keeps fingerprints away from the front. One difference from the picture -- the key pad is all black, and not white and black as in the photo.<br /><br />The 0.9 capacity is just right. I also have a 0.7 capacity machine, but that has a problem with any dish that's larger than 11 inches. The 0.9 gives you a decent amount of interior space, but doesn't take up much more counter space than the 0.7.<br /><br />It has 900 watts of power, and does a good job of heating foods quickly. The interior light is bright and comes on when the unit is running or the door is open. Reasonably quiet when it is running - typical noise level for a microwave.<br /><br />Can't speak to reliability as of yet, but it comes with a 12 month warranty that is extended to 18 months if you register it online.<br /><br />Great machine if you're looking for something that is small, but still very usable.

There aren't that many drawer microwaves available.  Why buy a drawer microwave?  Well, the most important reason is that my wife wanted one in our new house!  Her arguments were as follows:  1) no need to lift or inspect foods over her head, 2) made space for a vent. While microwaves can generally be vented from the front or the above (top), our new house didn't have any vent.  So, all cooking fumes were vented into the room.  With this oven, we removed the cabinet above the existing microwave and installed a stainless steel vent hood (above the range).  Still, not perfectly ventalated.  I had to modify a base cabinet near the stove to accept the drawer microwave.  Not a problem for me as I am a woodworker, but a problem or extra costs for others.  In addition, I had to add an electrical outlet.  Not a problem for me as I am a retired electrical engineer, but maybe a cost for others.  After the installation, simple enough, the drawer didn't want to stay closed.  That is, you push the close button and the drawer closed but re-opened immediately.  I was about to call for service but I did the following:  push the drawer closed manually, that is by hand.  This seemed to work and then the automatic closure mechanism started working okay.  So, no service call required.  The only shortcomings I see are that the power is not as great as our prior microwave and that there isn't a rotating table.  Dispite this, we are happy with this model so far after about a year.  Shorter people may like this oven a lot, and, it is REALLY COOL!

Soooo, today I called Whirlpool to discuss the problem...the first person that I spoke with offered me a contract for $285 that she said would cover the service call, all parts & labor, plus would give me warranty coverage for 1 year.  Since the service call was going to be $129, I accepted the $285 offer (which I had to accept within 24 hours or it would not be offered to me again).  After verifying at least 3 times that this would cover all expenses incurred, I gave her my credit card # and she transferred me to what was to be the service appointment scheduling extension; actually, it was the extended warranty department, who told me that this $285 contract did not cover handles, knobs, etc...one hour later (was I frustrated by this or what???) still on the phone, having been transferred at least 6 times (each person I spoke with had the same message...I apologize).  I didn't want any more apologies...I wanted action!!!  The only action I got after FINALLY speaking with a supervisor was that I could cancel the contract (as if I didn't know this much), but it would take a few days to have my credit card credited.  Oh, when I told one of the 6 people I spoke with during that hour that I Googled this problem and found that I was not the only one that experienced this, she told me that competitors post those comments on Amazon.com...grrrrr.

I actually purchased mine online from walmart, but I order from amazon alot and wanted to put my review here for all of you. I've had mine almost 2 months now. It has a 3 prong grounding plug. It's 900 watts and heats things up a lot faster than my other microwave, so I'm still getting use to that. I'm going to try and address everything I see people asking questions about. First off, when you hit a number, for example 2, it will automatically start cooking 2 minutes. You can press the start button and add 30 seconds. If you want a specific time, for example 3 minutes and 45 seconds, you can press the power button, then the numbers, 3,4, and 5.  It will start cooking 3 min. 45 secs. It has a lot of buttons for specific items like popcorn, pizza, dinner plate, defrost, etc. It has a normal hum when running. It has a turntable. The clock is displayed in green. It beeps 5 times, not super loud but loud enough, then stops. The light comes on when you open the door and while cooking. It has an easy to use child safety lock to lock the door. I've not had any problems with fingerprints on the exterior.The handle pulls easily. It has a nice weight to it. I have mine on a cabinet with grip bottom shelving paper under it, so I don't know if it would slide on a smooth surface or not, mine doesn't.  The inside dimensions are 12 in. wide, 12 in. deep, and 8 in. high. The turntable plate is 10 1/2 in.  Plenty of room for most things you microwave. For the outside dimensions, the width (side to side) is 19 in., the height is 11 1/2 in. The outside dimensions given for depth includes the slight protrusion in back and the handle. The actual microwave is 13 in deep without the handle and protrusion in the back. Here's the best way to let you know the depth to know if it will fit on your shelf or wherever else you put it. I have my microwave sitting on a cabinet which is 1 in. from the wall. I have it sitting 1 1/2 in. from the back of the cabinet. The actual protrusion is about 1 in from the back of the cabinet. There are vents in the back (and on the side opposite the handle-left side if you're facing the microwave) plus the protrusion, so it needs some space. This means I have it 2 1/2 in. total from the wall. It comes out 15 in. from the back of my cabinet. The front legs sit back 2 1/2 in., which means that it is 12 1/2 in. from the back of my cabinet to the front legs. So, if your shelf is 12 1/2 in. deep, the legs would all fit on the shelf with the protrusion being 1 in. from the back of your shelf. I have the extra inch from the back of the cabinet to the wall, so if you don't, you might need your shelf to be at least 13 to 13 1/2 in. deep to give you more vent space. I think this covers everything. I think you'll be satisfied if you purchase this microwave.from the back of the cabinet. The actual protrusion is about 1 in from the back of the cabinet.

Having the WARRANTY is worse than not having one.  The Microwave is not working from just around Christmas.  Early January, it should have been fixed.  The Service company called and told me that the parts are not available, so the next possible touch point is Feb 18th.  So, looking at guaranteed no microwave for about 2 months, and even after that there is uncertainty when it would be fixed.  Had I NOT had the Warranty, I would have just taken a loss and gone ahead an purchased another Microwave of a brand called NOT FRIGIDAIRE.  ===========  - This Microwave lasted less than 6 months  - Of course you think all should be fine because it is under warranty.  - Yes, it is under warranty, BUT:    a) you are given the direct contact of a Service Provider, and you are no longer working with Frigidaire directly.    b) So, the buck is passed from Frigidaire over to a third party Appliance Service company    c) The appliance service company guy came, took a look at the Microwave and said they will need to order parts either from their local supplier, or directly from distributor. This could take up to 10 days  So, now you are left hanging without a  Microwave for 10 days or more.

If I could give half-stars, I would give the LG a 4.5 at this point. It was very reasonably priced compared to others with similar features, and reasonably easy to install.  It does a good job overall, has some features that the Spacemaker did not have, but also lacks some nice features that the (much more expensive) Spacemaker had.    Here's what I really like about the LG:  1. Multiple speed exhaust fan with timer.  2. More time/Less time buttons.  3. Soften/Melt/Defrost settings work well.  4. Turntable on/off setting is useful for large or oblong cooking vessels.  5. Popcorn, hot dog settings are very accurate.  6. Hold Warm feature keeps cooked items at a safe temp for up to 90 minutes.  7. It doesn't need the clock set just to use the microwave, (like the Spacemaker did.)  8. It works reliably every time I use it!    Here's what I feel the LG lacks:  1. Doesn't remind you after cooking is finished (the Spacemaker beeped discreetly every 30 seconds for up to an hour).  2. Reheat settings are sometimes a bit too aggressive.  3. Can't adjust the volume of the beeps when setting or finishing cooking (default volume is a bit loud).  4. Aesthetically, the black window on the front is not as attractive as the Spacemaker's white window.  5. Although the EZ-ON button starts and adds 30 second increments, a Quick-Minute button would be useful.  6. The turntable is smaller than it could be (although this has not really presented any problems).  7. The Spacemaker had an automatic nightlight feature, the LG does not (this is a small inconvenience).    At this point in its lifetime, I would recommend this microwave.  If that changes, I'll update this review accordingly.",8/8/2011,0.9171583652496338,"['purchased', 'microwave', 'October', 'years', 'months', 'ago', 'disastrous', 'experience', 'GE', 'Spacemaker', 'could', 'give', 'would', 'give', 'LG', 'point', 'reasonably', 'priced', 'compared', 'others', 'similar', 'features', 'reasonably', 'easy', 'install', 'good', 'job', 'overall', 'features', 'Spacemaker', 'also', 'lacks', 'nice', 'features', 'much', 'expensive', 'Spacemaker', 'really', 'like', 'LG', 'Multiple', 'speed', 'exhaust', 'fan', 'timer', 'time', 'buttons', 'settings', 'work', 'well', 'Turntable', 'setting', 'useful', 'large', 'oblong', 'cooking', 'vessels', 'Popcorn', 'hot', 'dog', 'settings', 'accurate', 'Hold', 'Warm', 'feature', 'keeps', 'cooked', 'items', 'safe', 'temp', 'minutes', 'need', 'clock', 'set', 'use', 'microwave', 'like', 'Spacemaker', 'works', 'reliably', 'every', 'time', 'use', 'feel', 'LG', 'lacks', 'remind', 'cooking', 'finished', 'Spacemaker', 'beeped', 'discreetly', 'every', 'seconds', 'hour', 'Reheat', 'settings', 'sometimes', 'bit', 'aggressive', 'Ca', 'adjust', 'volume', 'beeps', 'setting', 'finishing', 'cooking', 'default', 'volume', 'bit', 'loud', 'Aesthetically', 'black', 'window', 'front', 'attractive', 'Spacemaker', 'white', 'window', 'Although', 'button', 'starts', 'adds', 'second', 'increments', 'button', 'would', 'useful', 'turntable', 'smaller', 'could', 'although', 'really', 'presented', 'problems', 'Spacemaker', 'automatic', 'nightlight', 'feature', 'LG', 'small', 'inconvenience', 'point', 'lifetime', 'would', 'recommend', 'microwave', 'changes', 'update', 'review', 'accordingly']"

When you cook at 50% power, it cooks at 50% power rather than cycling on and off at 100% power, for 50% of the time.  This makes a massive difference on how things cook.  We previously had a GH5184XPS with Accuwave that lasted 4 years before it stopped cooking.  It was starting to not look so nice from normal use, so I decided to go with a new one instead of repairing the old one.      After the new microwave was installed, I tried a cup of water in it.  When I started it, it sounded like an arc welder, and when I looked at the plastic panel on the right side where the magnetron is, it looked like an arc torch flame.  I quickly turned it off so it wouldn't burn the place down.  They took it back and gave me another.  The very night we got it, we were making popcorn in the special Microwave Popcorn bowl, which we had used for years with our other microwaves.  Within a minute, we got an F7 - Call For Service code.  They offered to exchange it for a new one, but didn't have another, but told me they could sell me the new 5184, and updated model of our old one.  I noticed that the new one had a broiler, slightly different menus, $50 cheaper, and we had good luck with our previous 5184.  However, after it was installed, the cook said, this doesn't cook right.  I checked it out.  The updated 5184 no longer has Accuwave.  That isn't how it was represented, so I gave them their $50 back and had them order another one of these from the factory.  That went along for 3 days before we noticed that part way through the cooking time, the magnetron noise would stop, the fan speed up, the light got brighter, and the food stopped cooking.  Since the chicken was still pink, I added 2 minutes at full power, and immediately received an F7 code.  The problem actually started when it stopped cooking during the previous operation.  You don't get the F7 until you try to start it again,and the magnetron doesn't start.  We couldn't trust it with chicken.  We avoided certain foods and alternated between manual and automatic cycles to get around the F7 codes.  As time progressed, we could do less and less.  Now, you can't even trust it to finish a bowl of oatmeal.      That was enough for me.  There is no possibility of buying a good one from the factory, so there is no point in getting another new one.  Thus, I decided I would use warranty service to see if they can put in good parts that WILL work.  The dealer-recommended warranty repair source wouldn't take the job when he learned which model it was.  Whirlpool got another company to come the following morning.  They put a large bowl of water in the microwave to test it, and could find nothing wrong.  They said their manual doesn't even list an F7 code.  There is nothing easier on a microwave than a large bowl of water.  I went on the internet and printed off one of a myriad of postings about F7 for this microwave model, with detail instructions on how to troubleshoot.  Then I put real food in the microwave and showed them how easy it is to get an F7.  Included in the troubleshooting instructions were comments from the techs that service these every day who state that they always go through the procedure to eliminate any other causes, but it always ends up being the expensive microprocessor board.  The on-site techs did not follow the checklist, and called the factory.  The factory told them they will send them a switch to try.  (I was hoping it would be the thermal switch, but the techs indicated it was not.)  The on-site techs reminded the factory that the problem starts mid-cycle.  The factory came back with, as it gets hotter, the switch contacts may be increasing resistance, causing the problem.  I could repeat the F7 at will.  They did not check the switch for high resistance nor follow the factory procedure to troubleshoot the F7 error.  Next Wednesday, the switch is scheduled to be delivered, and the techs will be returning to put it in.  The service company also had little confidence in the factory's recommendation, but they have to do what the factory says.  Perhaps the fist service company has gone through this before and may be why they wouldn't take the job for this model.      I've been through 3 of this model, and 4 installs, since April 5 2011, and I don't have a good microwave yet.  They've eaten up more of my time than the microwave is worth.  Now it's my turn.  I will make it my personal mission to require them to keep sending technicians to my house to fix this model until it works as advertised, on real food, or supply me with a model of equal to or greater value, that works as advertised, for free, and with a new warranty.",6/22/2011,0.2477679252624512,"['like', 'Aid', 'microwaves', 'offer', 'models', 'Accuwave', 'cooking', 'cook', 'power', 'cooks', 'power', 'rather', 'cycling', 'power', 'time', 'makes', 'massive', 'difference', 'things', 'cook', 'previously', 'Accuwave', 'lasted', 'years', 'stopped', 'cooking', 'starting', 'look', 'nice', 'normal', 'use', 'decided', 'go', 'new', 'one', 'instead', 'repairing', 'old', 'one', 'new', 'microwave', 'installed', 'tried', 'cup', 'water', 'started', 'sounded', 'like', 'arc', 'welder', 'looked', 'plastic', 'panel', 'right', 'side', 'magnetron', 'looked', 'like', 'arc', 'torch', 'flame', 'quickly', 'turned', 'would', 'burn', 'place', 'took', 'back', 'gave', 'another', 'night', 'got', 'making', 'popcorn', 'special', 'Microwave', 'Popcorn', 'bowl', 'used', 'years', 'microwaves', 'Within', 'minute', 'got', 'Call', 'Service', 'code', 'offered', 'exchange', 'new', 'one', 'another', 'told', 'could', 'sell', 'new', 'updated', 'model', 'old', 'one', 'noticed', 'new', 'one', 'broiler', 'slightly', 'different', 'menus', 'cheaper', 'good', 'luck', 'previous', 'However', 'installed', 'cook', 'said', 'cook', 'right', 'checked', 'updated', 'longer', 'Accuwave', 'represented', 'gave', 'back', 'order', 'another', 'one', 'factory', 'went', 'along', 'days', 'noticed', 'part', 'way', 'cooking', 'time', 'magnetron', 'noise', 'would', 'stop', 'fan', 'speed', 'light', 'got', 'brighter', 'food', 'stopped', 'cooking', 'Since', 'chicken', 'still', 'pink', 'added', 'minutes', 'full', 'power', 'immediately', 'received', 'code', 'problem', 'actually', 'started', 'stopped', 'cooking', 'previous', 'operation', 'get', 'try', 'start', 'magnetron', 'start', 'could', 'trust', 'chicken', 'avoided', 'certain', 'foods', 'alternated', 'manual', 'automatic', 'cycles', 'get', 'around', 'codes', 'time', 'progressed', 'could', 'less', 'less', 'ca', 'even', 'trust', 'finish', 'bowl', 'oatmeal', 'enough', 'possibility', 'buying', 'good', 'one', 'factory', 'point', 'getting', 'another', 'new', 'one', 'Thus', 'decided', 'would', 'use', 'warranty', 'service', 'see', 'put', 'good', 'parts', 'work', 'warranty', 'repair', 'source', 'would', 'take', 'job', 'learned', 'model', 'Whirlpool', 'got', 'another', 'company', 'come', 'following', 'morning', 'put', 'large', 'bowl', 'water', 'microwave', 'test', 'could', 'find', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'said', 'manual', 'even', 'list', 'code', 'nothing', 'easier', 'microwave', 'large', 'bowl', 'water', 'went', 'internet', 'printed', 'one', 'myriad', 'postings', 'microwave', 'model', 'detail', 'instructions', 'troubleshoot', 'put', 'real', 'food', 'microwave', 'showed', 'easy', 'get', 'Included', 'troubleshooting', 'instructions', 'comments', 'techs', 'service', 'every', 'day', 'state', 'always', 'go', 'procedure', 'eliminate', 'causes', 'always', 'ends', 'expensive', 'microprocessor', 'board', 'techs', 'follow', 'checklist', 'called', 'factory', 'factory', 'told', 'send', 'switch', 'try', 'hoping', 'would', 'thermal', 'switch', 'techs', 'indicated', 'techs', 'reminded', 'factory', 'problem', 'starts', 'factory', 'came', 'back', 'gets', 'hotter', 'switch', 'contacts', 'may', 'increasing', 'resistance', 'causing', 'problem', 'could', 'repeat', 'check', 'switch', 'high', 'resistance', 'follow', 'factory', 'procedure', 'troubleshoot', 'error', 'Next', 'Wednesday', 'switch', 'scheduled', 'delivered', 'techs', 'returning', 'put', 'service', 'company', 'also', 'little', 'confidence', 'factory', 'recommendation', 'factory', 'says', 'Perhaps', 'fist', 'service', 'company', 'gone', 'may', 'would', 'take', 'job', 'model', 'model', 'installs', 'since', 'April', 'good', 'microwave', 'yet', 'eaten', 'time', 'microwave', 'worth', 'turn', 'make', 'personal', 'mission', 'require', 'keep', 'sending', 'technicians', 'house', 'fix', 'model', 'works', 'advertised', 'real', 'food', 'supply', 'model', 'equal', 'greater', 'value', 'works', 'advertised', 'free', 'new', 'warranty']"

Unreliable and now is DEAD!,"This machine's finish quality was off out of the box.  The door didn't quite line up with it's case when closed and there were a couple small dents on the lower left of the door as well.    These were tolerable, however, as long as the machine worked - and it did... sometimes.    For example, from the start this machine would occasionally shut off mid-cooking, as in the timer would go blank, the light would go out, and the food would still be pretty cold.      Other times the food would seem to be heating up pretty well but then the machine would shut off.  On those occasions we thought it might have quit because it was getting too much steam on its sensors (wherever they might have been) so we would wrap foods extremely tightly with plastic wrap - still to no avail.      On still other occasions the food **looked** like it was being cooked (light stayed on, the table rotated, the timer counted down, and tone sounded at the end) but then it would turn out to be only ever so slightly warmer than when originally put in.    After a year of our just making do with this machine's cranky behavior and then just planning our meals without microwave use it died altogether.    My wife and I can only say, Good riddance! in response.    Consumer Reports lists this microwave as a best buy and, honestly, that's why I bought it in the first place.

If you have a double oven, then I think you are better off with a standard high quality microwave.    This is a high speed microwave convection oven; but due to the size of the cavity the conv oven takes longer to heat up.  About 10 minutes to reach 350. Once preheated convection works good.      Does a nice job with frozen pizza, rib roast, chicken, etc. This makes really good toast in 6 minutes, 3 minutes per side, you have to flip the bread. But I don't think it saves any time.  Also, when you use the convection oven, remember it has to cool down to use it again as a microwave. That can take another 10-15 minutes.    Bought mine about 4 yrs ago with a 5yr extended warranty. Within the last month, a piece of plastic trim fell off, door handle cracked, and the touch screen started randomly simulating keypresses.    Repair service came out 3x to get the right parts ordered and repaired, maybe it's fixed.  Will find out.    Cooks well.  The best feature is that this is a variable microwave; unlike most units that simply turn the magnetron on and off to vary the Power %, this one actually reduces the power itself... very cool.  This also combines microwave with convection bake and grill capabilities, and you can control the bake temp as well as the % of microwave to use. For grilling you control the microwave % but not the grill temp, as the grill halogen just stays on the whole time.  That isactually a very nice feature.  On my regular oven, the broiler turns off at 500.    So from that standpoint the unit is pretty smart.    Get this on a firesale if you can... get a long term 5yr + extended warranty, you will use it.    As other's point out, it doesn't have program cooking, can't do a delayed start, can't do multiple programs in sequence, doesn't have a meat thermometer, but it does have a lot of pre-sets.

I also wanted enough space left on the counter so that, if necessary, when removing something from the microwave, I could sit the container on the counter immediately in front of the microwave.  I had a small 24 inch wide by 14 inch deep nook available between my refrigerator and the corner appliance garage, but was certain I would not find a suitable microwave to fit.  Since we were not replacing cabinets, I had to work with the available spaces.<br /><br />To my surprise, the GE Profile Spacemaker II was the exact size of the nook!  Although there were many negative reviews of the product, I decided to take a chance on this microwave and purchased one at Best Buy.  Through an abundance of caution, I also purchased an additional 4 year warranty so that if I experience any of the problems others have encountered, I will be able to have the Spacemaker II repaired or replaced.  As the extended warranty was only a little more than a service call would cost, I felt it was worth the expenditure.<br /><br />So far, I am very pleased with the GE Profile Spacemaker II microwave.  My spouse and I do not cook meals in our microwave, but do reheat beverages; cook frozen vegetables and veggie burgers; and, occasionally, defrost meat.  The Spacemaker performs these functions admirably!  Although it takes about 30% more time to heat/cook things than my 1100 watt microwave, this has not been a problem.  Further, I like this model better for defrosting as it does not start cooking the meat like the more powerful models do.  The control panel buttons are very responsive.  I have cracked other microwave's button surfaces because of the difficulty in getting them to respond to my touch.  I do not foresee this occuring with the Spacemaker II.<br /><br />In the past, I have allowed bread to raise inside my microwave.  I found this allowed me to leave the bowl or pan uncovered as there is no air flow inside the microwave, and the temperature remains consistent.  The Spacemaker's interior is large enough for me to continue using the microwave in which to raise bread.<br /><br />Because I keep this microwave on my counter, I keep a plastic glass of water in it to prevent accidentally starting it empty and possibly ruining the magnatron.<br /><br />Further, I would caution those who are looking for a compact microwave for an elderly individual who may be confused by having to choose among multiple function buttons.  The GE Profile Spacemaker II has a control panel that can be confusing as it has 29 separate buttons from which to choose.  Thus, it might not be the best choice for individuals.<br /><br />For me, the GE Profile Spacemaker II is the ideal microwave and I am giving it a five-star rating.  If things change, I will update my review accordingly.s button surfaces because of the difficulty in getting them to respond to my touch.  I do not foresee this occuring with the Spacemaker II.

My older and twice as expensive Whirlpool died and I didn't want to spend another 500 bucks on something that I now realize is a disposable item. When these break, almost any repair will cost as much as a new unit so I decided to stop buying top tier on these ovens. This unit was easy to install. It's lighter than my Whirlpool was, so I was able to hoist it onto the mounting plate myself and start the top screws without a problem. I think perhaps those who are complaining about the weight bought the larger model? Who knows. Sometimes it's hard to tell what some folks bought in these Amazon reviews.<br /><br />As others report, the fan is REALLY loud. Wow. And low fan is just as loud. The fan is definitely the down side. I found that the light is bright enough. Cooking is fast. The control panel is very Spartan. Oh, it has all the buttons, but where my old microwave said Pizza and Casserole etc. in the display, this one just has a numeral and you'll have to refer to the book a bit until you get the hang of it. Most of my cooking is just hitting the quick button anyway, so let's be real. I'm glad it doesn't have a lot of features I'll seldom use and that I would have had to pay for. The door looks solid enough to me. I see no problem with keeping it clean that others have reported, but perhaps that's because mine is white? So it's a good basic microwave, as cheap as they come and it works just fine. I consider it a 5-star cheap microwave.<br /><br />Edit added:<br />Well, it has stopped working properly after 6 months. Most annoying is that the interior light will not turn off even though the door switches are working properly. While I liked the Spartan controls, my wife learned to detest that feature. I've decided not to have it repaired under warranty, but to be rid of it and buy a unit with better build quality. I'm dropping it down to 3 stars.

When it works, it is fabulous, unfortunately that just isn't often enough.  We had this microwave for @ 3½ years and if we were lucky, we got 2½ years of use our of it.  Sadly, the sophistication of this appliance seems to be its Achilles heel.  There are so many feature to break and they do!    I could accept the fact that our unit was a lemon, however this was the second unit I purchased...the first died in two days and it was decided that the retailer would just take it back.  Also, a good friend of ours purchased the same model and has had numerous issues of their own...with their door components (LCD panel, etc) replaced multiple times.    We love the microwave, but just can't handle the constant breakdowns and huge delays in repair...typically down for a month due to delays in service calls, all parts having to be ordered, then waiting for tech to come back...and in many cases, waiting for them to order more parts. When the unit is down, not only don't you have a microwave, you don't have an exhaust fan, so there's an impact to all of your cooking!    Below is a recap (of the items I could remember) of our Whirlpool adventure:    Microwave Purchased - 9/7/07  Warranty Issues:  6/23/08 - Glass turntable shattered when sizzle pan was heating, LCD display issues  7/1/08 -- Service Call - Parts ordered  7/17/08 - Replaced several parts, issue not resolved - Parts ordered  8/11/08 - Replaced several parts, issue not resolved - Parts ordered  8/18/08 - Replaced several parts, issue not resolved - Parts ordered  9/4/08 - Replaced 17 parts - Issue resolved    Extended (3rd party) Warranty:  1/29/2009 - No display on LCD, unit non-functional  2/?/2009 - Replaced Control board, connector  12/14/2009 - Magnetron not heating/cooling fan not running.  Tech was onsite for approx 5 min, did little/no testing and decided to order AC Filter board (along with previously broken plastic components from earlier repairs)  12/24/2009 - Tech determined incorrect part (AC filter board) ordered, so placed order for 19 additional parts and left with no further action.  1/7/2010 - Replaced 19 parts - didn't fix original issue (Magnetron not heating/cooling fan not running) and caused a new issue - exhaust fan not functioning - this was a 6 hour service call.  Six additional parts ordered - microwave left in pieces and not re-installed on wall.  1/14/10 - Tech replaced 6 additional parts (3 hr call), (LCD control board, upper front plastic frame, magnetron cooling fan, wiring harnesses).  Issue with exhaust fan was determined to be bad new relay control board (replaced on last call).  Tech installed original board (which had a visible burn mark on it and unit worked.  Tech order new relay control board.  - Unit worked when tech's left, however by the end of the day, the display was flashing and non-functional.   1/20/10 - Control board arrived and installed and the exhaust fan did not work, and issue with the LCD was not resolved.  Re-installed original relay control board and exhaust fan worked, LCD issue still occuring.  1/21/10 - Tech attempted to address issues and after having signifigant problems, escalated to advance support.

We've had this unit for 8 months and it has performed flawlessly with daily moderate use. We use it mostly for baked potatoes, leftovers, popcorn, defrosting, etc, so we haven't subjected it to heavy use. Although it's only 700 watts, it gets the job done in a reasonable amount of time (2 medium potatoes in 9 minutes). The black/stainless steel casing and classic styling appealled to us also.

No issues.  Installed it and it worked great--for less than 4 months.  The microwave stopped working 3 days before Thanksgiving.  Called factory service, 2 weeks.  The appointment is scheduled for 8-12.  They show up at 11:55.  They stay until 2:00--yup it's broke, but we need parts and 2 people.  2 more weeks, parts are shipped to our house and service calls to confirm they are here.  (Factory service that doesn't have parts--interesting way to do business!)  They show up at 11:58--seriously.  Two hours (and another vacation day burned) and the replacement parts are defective.  (Warm fuzzy--not!)  Two more weeks--and they canceled their appointment.  Seems it takes two people to install it and the wonderful factory service only scheduled one.    So the top of the line microwave with convection oven will spend Christmas in the garage.  My newly remodeled kitchen a gaping hole with metal mounting plate for all my guests to admire.    I have e-mailed Whirlpool--will update if and when we get this very frustrating and disappointing mess resolved.    Thinking of buying this brand/item--save yourself--don't!      Update 12-28-09:  Well they canceled their appointment to fix it again.  They now have us waiting another 2 weeks before they can get someone to try and fix it.  Whirlpool customer service contacted us and said the only option we have is to get it fixed, they will not replace their defective equipment.  So it is still sitting in my garage waiting for someone to show up.      The great news is Santa did bring me a microwave to sit on my counter just in case my hopes that the repairmen soon will be here wouldn't happen.  It is a Sharp.  Bare bones model but it works! Santa is a wise man!    Oh--and where will my Whirlpool microwave be spending New Year's?  The garage.    February 28--after 5 more appointments--2 of which they failed to show Whirlpool agreed to replace the microwave.  We have the new one 3 days.

It works pretty well. I like the Inverter defrost capabilities. Recently (Dec. '09) the oven bulb (part# WB36X10302) burnt out. Not a critical problem but a definite pain in the a**. So far my choices in fixing it are:    1) Open it up and poke around trying to fix it myself. Carefully! There's reported to be high voltage capacitors in there that can permanently ruin your day and all your days to come. There is apparently no manual available that will tell you how do do this or what to watch out for.    2) pay for a GE technician to come to the house ($69) and replace the bulb ($12-$20 I think, the GE appointment scheduler doesn't know but I found it online for $11.75) PLUS LABOR.   How much do GE techs charge per hour? GE maint. doesn't know or won't say. How long will it take to complete the job? GE maint. doesn't know or won't say.   Let's estimate that the labor involved takes half an hour to pull the cover off and dismantle the thing enough to get to the bulb and replace it. If the tech charges only $50/hr (probably considerably more) that's a total of $106 (house call + parts + labor). I paid $233 for the thing new.

Every appliance in our kitchen is new and this particular appliance is my favorite due to the uniqueness and convenience of this model. This microwave has exceeded our expectations in every way. One of the reasons we bought this microwave was that we needed a microwave that would fit under the countertop so our kids could reach it. It is also nice that the door slides open and I can reach down to lift out the food instead of having to reach up at face level and lift food out and down. I liked the unique concept of a drawer that pulls open instead of a door that pops open. I was a little concerned about reviews on earlier models that the auto open and close function on this microwave has a tendency to break. However, it seems that Sharp decided to manufacture this one so it closes with a button or by pushing or pulling on it to eliminate that problem. I was also concerned that it didn't have a piece in it that rotates the food. So, we were surprised to find that none of the food we have cooked has hotspots (note: I only use my microwave for reheating...not cooking). I LOVE this microwave. I had considered purchasing the 30 but decided that it was unlikely that I would need to put a dish in the microwave that was bigger than 24. So far, this has been the perfect size. It is even tall enough that I can put my portable mug in it to heat up my tea. Also, my lovely daughter did not know that you can't put metal in the microwave. She put her fork in with her plate. Surprisingly, the microwave did not arch. We checked the manual and it said you can even use aluminum foil to cover portions of meat. Not sure how they do it, but I'm not likely to try it. The microwave seems fine after the fork episode. This microwave also has programmable features such as softening ice cream. It asks what size of ice cream then sets the time as appropriate. It's a nice feature but I'm not usually softening a whole tub ofice cream. Just a portion of a tub. One other feature I use frequently, pushing the power button after closing the drawer will turn on the microwave in one minute increments. As an example, pushing the button 3 times will equate to 3 minutes. This is a pricey microwave but has been well worth the expense in our experience.

Other models require some extra space in front of the microwave on the left side, to be able to open the door. It is not a problem for most kitchens, but if you have a deep cabinet to the left of the microwave that extends in front of oven, Sharp seems like the only option. Sharp has put a smaller door that starts about an inch from the left side of the microwave, so it opens freely.    So far I was not disappointed. I'm mostly using the microwave mode, convectional mode. It cooks well, and the menu is rather intiutive - what else do you need? Auto reheat works well and produces consistently good results. I was not getting very good result with mixed mode (oven + microwave) though.    There are some faults in this model, that I think Sharp should've done better, so it only got 4 starts:  1) The menu system could be better. E.g. the Start button on most microwaves also serves as 'Add minute' or 'Add 30sec', but here it would not do anything - one has to use dedicated 'Add minute' button. I got used to it, but my guests can't easily find this button.  2) The fan is very very loud. It has two speeds, but even with reduced speed, it is very loud. It does not look extremely powerful either.  3) The range light is generated by two small incandescent bulbs. I would expect energy efficient fluorescent lamps or LEDs for this high-end oven. They could've perfectly fit a long tube there, but have instead put old unefficient incandescent bulbs.  4) The interior is stainless steeel, but it is not very smooth, so it takes some effort to clean the microwave.",10/13/2008,0.12271234393119812,"['selected', 'model', 'convectional', 'microwave', 'oven', 'fits', 'kitchen', 'models', 'require', 'extra', 'space', 'front', 'microwave', 'left', 'side', 'able', 'open', 'door', 'problem', 'kitchens', 'deep', 'cabinet', 'left', 'microwave', 'extends', 'front', 'oven', 'Sharp', 'seems', 'like', 'option', 'Sharp', 'put', 'smaller', 'door', 'starts', 'inch', 'left', 'side', 'microwave', 'opens', 'freely', 'far', 'disappointed', 'mostly', 'using', 'microwave', 'mode', 'convectional', 'mode', 'cooks', 'well', 'menu', 'rather', 'intiutive', 'else', 'need', 'Auto', 'reheat', 'works', 'well', 'produces', 'consistently', 'good', 'results', 'getting', 'good', 'result', 'mixed', 'mode', 'oven', 'microwave', 'though', 'faults', 'model', 'think', 'Sharp', 'done', 'better', 'got', 'starts', 'menu', 'system', 'could', 'better', 'Start', 'button', 'microwaves', 'also', 'serves', 'minute', 'would', 'anything', 'one', 'use', 'dedicated', 'minute', 'button', 'got', 'used', 'guests', 'ca', 'easily', 'find', 'button', 'fan', 'loud', 'two', 'speeds', 'even', 'reduced', 'speed', 'loud', 'look', 'extremely', 'powerful', 'either', 'range', 'light', 'generated', 'two', 'small', 'incandescent', 'bulbs', 'would', 'expect', 'energy', 'efficient', 'fluorescent', 'lamps', 'LEDs', 'oven', 'could', 'perfectly', 'fit', 'long', 'tube', 'instead', 'put', 'old', 'unefficient', 'incandescent', 'bulbs', 'interior', 'stainless', 'steeel', 'smooth', 'takes', 'effort', 'clean', 'microwave']"

I loved the old one, even though it only lasted 9 years, but this one has been a tremendous disappointment.   First off, Amazon does not tell you until AFTER your purchase that they subcontract out delivery to a third party who prohibits you from speaking with the driver via his cellphone and thinks nothing of dropping the ball re customer communication: I wasted an entire day waiting for a delivery man who did not ring my bell as instructed and had instead delivered it to my super, which no one bothered to tell me. The delivery was an extremely frustrating fiasco.  Amazon needs to take more responsibility vis a vis decent delivery services.   Next point of disappointment:  I paid two men to install this monster.  (It's practically 80 lbs. and impossible to install solo).  So they get it in and fitting properly into the drop-in shelf designed to hold it. Then comes another surprise: Every time I turn it on, it makes a tremendous rattley racket not unlike a jet turbine - nothing at all like the smooth, quiet operation of its predecessor. This noise is so loud you can't even think about listening to NPR or a fellow kitchen occupant during the oven's operation. If I press firmly on the door of the microwave while it's on, the noise mutes, but who can stand in front of the microwave pressing on it every time you  zap a potato?  I'm not sure if the ace delivery company rattled something loose inside this particular appliance, or if this series model contains a design flaw, but the noise is really horrible.   There's more: I was very impressed with the ease of baking in this oven - the programming is  simple enough for a liberal arts major to grasp quite easily. But every time I use the convection function (closely following all the instructions re appropriate containers, elevating the foodstuffs off the rotating plate, etc.,) the oven gives off a menacing odor exactly like you sniff in a terrible electrical fire. There is nothing in the manual concerning either the noise issue or the smell issue.   I'm in NYC, where there are very few options when searching for a specific appliance (I tried to find one locally that would fit my shelf space), but if I could have, I would have previewed this model at a local retailer and seen how it worked there before springing for such an expensive lemon. Because this behemouth is such a hassle to remove and install, it's the kind of thing which, if you do buy it, you should buy with a guarantee of local on-site service.

Like others, I purchased this unit based on the recommendation in Consumer Reports; this recommendation didn't pan out.  I tried to schedule warranty service and GE is making us wait a week to schedule and their frustrating telephone system does not provide information on where I can take it for service for faster turnaround (and didn't put me in touch with a live representative).    When the microwave oven worked, it worked fine.  We replaced a Sharp unit with this one; though this unit has the advantage of a larger capacity, its controls are less intuitive.    Based on poor reliability and poor service, we're certainly not going to buy another GE microwave.  We've had good success with GE refrigerators in the past; this is very disappointing.

1574,36356690,RDZCZ2A55NN9X,B000UW1WW8,242727854,profile 2.2 cu. ft. countertop microwave w/child lockout and extra large,1,184,189,N,N,Larger and More Powerful But Short Service Life,"E. J. Tastad's review of this product is accurate and appropriate, but I would like to add some additional information.  I bought this GE Profile microwave oven in March of 2006 on the recommendation of Consumer Reports.  In September 2009 I am sorry to report that I had to throw it out because it wasn't worth repairing.  Consumer Reports gave this GE model their top rating for large microwave ovens.  It replaced an old Amana RadarRange that I had used for about 25 years before it burst into flames.  The Amana had also received Consumer Reports top rating back then.  If I recall, my Amana sold for about twice as much money (in 1981 dollars) as this GE costs in 2006 dollars.<br /><br />Since this microwave oven is more powerful, faster and consumes more electricity than small models, you may need to have a dedicated 20 ampere outlet available for its use.  Compared with my old Amana, the GE has a much more uniform distribution of heat when cooking or reheating, probably because the food is rotated on a turntable.  As E. J. Tastad found, the defrost cycle is easy to use, gives good distribution of heat and the front panel controls are fairly intuitive.  The stainless steel cabinet is attractive and easy to clean.<br /><br />Unlike my old Amana, this oven cannot multi-task.  For example, if you're running the built-in clock timer, you cannot cook or reheat something on a different schedule using different functions.  You must stop the clock timer to begin a cook cycle and vice versa.  You also cannot program several sequences of automatic operations as my old Amana could accommodate, nor can you program it to start at a later time.<br /><br />This microwave oven was not as reliable and did not last nearly as long as my old Amana did.  The magnetron tube in my GE Profile microwave oven failed after two years of use.  It's replacement was covered by the five-year GE warranty on the tube, but the warranty didn't cover the $85 in labor charges, which would have been even more if I had received the service on-site instead of taking the appliance to the appliance repair depot.  After 3 1/2 years of use, (September 2009) the main circuit board self-destructed.  It cost me $44 at the nearest GE repair facility to learn that it would cost me more than another $200 to replace the microwave oven's circuit board.<br /><br />Since other brands of similar-sized and power microwave ovens cost less than the repairs, I have discarded this microwave oven after 3 1/2 years and after spending $129 in diagnostic and repair charges in addition to the purchase price.  Given this experience, I now be hard-pressed to recommend this appliance considering its cost-of-ownership and short life.  This appliance should have lasted much longer.  It did not get heavy use and was never misused or abused.<br /><br />When I contacted GE about my failed microwave oven, they promised to make things right, asked for the model and serial number and requested that I cut off the appliance's power cord and plug and send it to them.  They then sent me a $100 rebate check that could be applied ONLY to another GE appliance purchase.  The check expired before I found another GE appliance that I wanted to own.<br /><br />I bought a replacement, which was a Panasonic model NN-SD978S microwave oven for less than $200 from Sam's Club.  It is just as large, cooks faster and has proven to be far more reliable.  After four years, it's still going strong without need for repairs.ore if I had received the service on-site instead of taking the appliance to the appliance repair depot.

The inverter defrost works almost perfectly every time, never cooking my food more than it should, but the reheat is a gimmick.<br /><br />This is a large countertop microwave, at about 2.2 cubic foot.  Coming from an over-the-range microwave this is a huge improvement in size.  The microwave heats uniformly and fast (it is 1200 watts).  The sensor reheat should only be used on foods it is safe to boil, otherwise it overcooks about everything else.  It also works best when you lightly cover the food, as sometimes uncovered food triggers it to turn off too early.  Lightly covered is critical, as the sensor works off water vapor temperature being released from the product.  If the water vapor cant leave the container it could become superheated.  Sensor cook should also only be used under supervision (you should be in the same room).<br /><br />I have had the microwave for about 6 months now with no issue.  It is no louder than other microwaves I have used, and the controls are intuitive and easy to use.  You do not have to press a cook button or anything to start your timed cooking.  My favorite feature is the inverter defrost.  Remember you enter the weight in pounds, so for an 8 oz pack of bacon you would enter 5 and start for 1/2 of a pound.  If you had a 1.5 pound package of meat, you would enter 15 and start for 1.5 pounds.  The display shows the weight correctly. Not much else to say about the product, it is a microwave after all.<br /><br />Update: To improve sensor reheat performance, use a lid over the food with a vent hole.  I use a paper plate with a small hole (finger tip size) punched in it.  This will make sure the reheat stays running long enough, but still gets some water vapor to judge the food temperature by so it doesn't over cook.<br /><br />Update (6/26/2010): I have been using the microwave 2 years now.  It has been no issue and still works perfectly.  I use the sensor reheat almost all the time for soups and casseroles, and use the inverter defrost for my frozen goods.  I also use the popcorn button to heat microwave popcorn bags.  Everything has been working great!<br /><br />Update (7/26/2011): Still going strong.  I use the inverter regularly for defrost, or lowering the power level to cook something slower.  It has worked well for me, and I think problems might be from shipping, quality control, or some other factor.<br /><br />Update (3/21/2013): Still going strong, but maybe a bit noisier now.

Every brand of microwave seems to have a malfunction-no help horror story. So in the end, if you chance having a microwave at all, this one seems better than most, if not all.  It works splendidly without any problem with noise or mechanical parts. My experience with Sharp Carousels has been 5 stars.  At home and work they have been dependable, efficient, good looking, and inexpensive.  Both the 2.0 and 1.4 cubic foot Carousels are commodious enough for large casseroles. When I designed my kitchen twenty years ago, I made two below-counter cabinet spaces to tuck in a medium and a large countertop microwave. I bought Carousels and have used them simultaneously almost daily.  They have been great workhorses.  The smaller one lost some of the digital display to no effect a few months ago, then made nasty little arcing noises last week and promptly was sent out to pasture. Last year I bought new stainless steel appliances (including Bosch dual fuel slide-in range-- the dream machine), and so I chose the stainless steel Sharp R-408LS Carousel 1.4 cubic foot/1100-W with a 14 inch turntable from BJ's ($99) as a replacement. The match with the other appliances was so good that I replaced the 2 cubic foot/1200-W with Sharp's R-520KS microwave as well. The display pads are lightly different, but better than losing size in the 1.4 cu. ft.  The Carousels match the Bosch oven door design remarkably, including the rounded window corners.  My kitchen looks better than when it was totally new with this addition.

I highly recommend it!,"I bought the Sharp R-520KS Microwave to replace my old White Westinghouse that stopped working after Thanksgiving.  I did alot of research before I bought this one.  I was worried I wouldn't find a microwave that worked as well as my last one.  The good thing is that I could finally replace my white microwave with stainless steel to match the appliances in my new house.  Now I had an excuse to replace it.  I was looking for a powerful 1200 watt microwave large enough to fit large dishes in, and this one had some of the best reviews, a decent price, and the stainless steel look I wanted.  I also needed a counter top model since I have no under cabinet space to put one.  This microwave works great!  I also like how the control panel doesn't have elevated buttons making it easy to wipe clean with no chance of food or anything getting stuck in the buttons.  It has some nice features like the hot water button (you tell it how many cups to heat), minute plus button, keep warm setting, and many others.  I've probably used the hot water and minute plus features the most.  There are sensor heating buttons, reheat buttons, and defrost buttons, although I haven't had a chance to use them as much yet.  The ones I have used so far work great!  My only minor complaint is the same as everyone else's, the buttons all look the same and the start/minute plus button and stop/cancel button are located in the midst of all the other buttons making it difficult to distinguish them quickly.  Not too much of an issue, but it would have been nice if those features were located on the bottom or the corner of the display and were different than the others.  It wouldn't keep me from purchasing this microwave since everything else is great and I'm sure I'll get used to them soon.  The microwave is also pretty large, so you can fit alot in there.  I've heated a cup of water and a dinner sized plate of food at the same time.  All in all, this microwave works great, looks great, and was reasonablypriced.

But let me tell you why this purchase was extra special. I was concerned about buying a microwave that had to be delivered (size, weight, fragile, etc) rather than from a local store .  But the selection at local stores like Best Buy was so bad, I placed the order. Unfortunately, the day it was supposedly delivered by UPS, no microwave arrived. I called UPS to see if I could start a tracer, but UPS told me that Amazon had to start the tracer because they sent the package. I went to the customer service site, couldn't find a phone number, and used the e-mail system. I thought - great - that e-mail will disappear into the ether, I may never hear from anybody, and here I am without my microwave.  That was about 8pm local time when I sent the e-mail. <br /> <br />The next morning when I checked my e-mail, I got quite a surprise. An Amazon rep wrote back, apologized my package had been lost, and re-ordered the item for me. Before too long, I had an e-mail the item was already shipping via 2-day delivery, and sure enough, 2 days later I had the replacement package. Wow! No hassle, no waiting, just great service. I couldn't believe it. I don't think I'll ever hesitate when I want to order something from Amazon again. I don't work for Amazon, they're not paying for this - I've actually never written a product review before. I was just so impressed with the customer service, I had to write. <br /> <br />The final chapter - the day before the replacement microwave arrived, the person who lives in the next cul-de-sac over from us, with the same house number, and with a street name similar to ours, showed up with the original microwave that UPS had mistakenly delivered to them. I wrote Amazon customer service an e-mail, and once again after a very quick response, I was able to arrange for UPS to come pick up the extra package.  Thanks Amazon.

First Sharp said they did not warrant cosmetic damage. I told them it was factory shipped that way, please send parts. They said NO! Ship it back to who I bought it from. I, after much argument, had to take it down and send it back. This ended up costing the seller shipping charges which they paid. I felt this was not right as Sharp could have easily fixed the problem. The shipper did not have another unit in stock, so I got a refund and ended up buying another brand locally.

They have holes drilled in the mount all the way across, so what I did was located two studs, drilled some 1/16th pilot holes in the bracket where they were and sunk (5) 1 3/4&quot; drywall screws in each stud from top to bottom of the bracket to attach it to the wall.  I didnt want to worry about the microwave falling off and either seriously injuring someone or smashing my new ceramic top stove.<br />Also be careful if drilling the top cabinet mount holes with the microwave in place, the bit can easily destroy the screw hole :)  I ended up replacing the two small upper cabinet mount screws with 1/2&quot; self tapping bolts.  So the cinnimon powder doesnt quite sit level up there in the cupboard.. but the microwave is definately not falling out of my wall!<br />As for functionality, the microwave is nice and powerful, the unsightly buttons are hidden behind the door (you punch in the settings when you open it).  A note of caution, dont put anything in it without the carousel tray to heat.  I had a small paper nacho bowl in there and it almost started the glue on fire in 20 seconds.<br />Another note... The carousel tray does not ship in this box well, mine arrived broken in half.  My only option was to ship the whole unit back (weighs like 80 lbs).  I lucked out because my old microwave was a Sharp and the carousel tray is identical.",6/25/2004,0.07575172185897827,"['pretty', 'big', 'heavy', 'unit', 'someone', 'around', 'help', 'mount', 'would', 'good', 'thing', 'found', 'sometimes', 'clips', 'back', 'little', 'trouble', 'popping', 'way', 'unless', 'lined', 'br', 'didnt', 'like', 'wall', 'mount', 'screws', 'whole', 'lot', 'well', 'fact', 'hold', 'whole', 'bracket', 'note', 'least', 'studs', 'holes', 'drilled', 'mount', 'way', 'across', 'located', 'two', 'studs', 'drilled', 'pilot', 'holes', 'bracket', 'sunk', 'quot', 'drywall', 'screws', 'stud', 'top', 'bottom', 'bracket', 'attach', 'wall', 'didnt', 'want', 'worry', 'microwave', 'falling', 'either', 'seriously', 'injuring', 'someone', 'smashing', 'new', 'ceramic', 'top', 'br', 'Also', 'careful', 'drilling', 'top', 'cabinet', 'mount', 'holes', 'microwave', 'place', 'bit', 'easily', 'destroy', 'screw', 'hole', 'ended', 'replacing', 'two', 'small', 'upper', 'cabinet', 'mount', 'screws', 'quot', 'self', 'tapping', 'bolts', 'cinnimon', 'powder', 'doesnt', 'quite', 'sit', 'level', 'microwave', 'definately', 'falling', 'wall', 'br', 'functionality', 'microwave', 'nice', 'powerful', 'unsightly', 'buttons', 'hidden', 'behind', 'door', 'punch', 'settings', 'open', 'note', 'caution', 'dont', 'put', 'anything', 'without', 'carousel', 'tray', 'heat', 'small', 'paper', 'nacho', 'bowl', 'almost', 'started', 'glue', 'fire', 'br', 'Another', 'note', 'carousel', 'tray', 'ship', 'box', 'well', 'mine', 'arrived', 'broken', 'half', 'option', 'ship', 'whole', 'unit', 'back', 'weighs', 'like', 'lbs', 'lucked', 'old', 'microwave', 'Sharp', 'carousel', 'tray', 'identical']"

Live & Learn   don't they test these designs in practical applications before releasing them to the consumer.....won't be buying anything from sharp company any time soon.   I purchased this microwave to replace a countertop model (emerson proffesional) stainless steel, I needed a spacesaving feature plus vent for stove and wanted stainless steel to match my other stainless steel appliances.  I purchased it from Amazon for $275. lowest price I could find and am currently waiting on a $30.rebate from sharp so for the price its not a bad deal.  It has no handle that makes it sleek looking and the control panel is hidden behind the door not used to having to set controls before closing door but it makes cleaning easier.  My countertop model was of higher quality stainless steel and i only paid $100. for it (on all sides) not just the front like this model  I installed this unit to vent vertically outside the damper is a bit flimsy but hopefully its been tested by sharp for reliability.  Exhaust fan unit detects heat from stove and automatically operates, unit is a bit noisy on either hi or low setting,wish it was quieter.The light has hi and low settings either is bright enough, more of a night light feature.  Overall it work fine and looks good. Not a high end unit but then again not a high end price.  It does have a nice feature that senses when your food is cooked, used it on potatoes which turned out great.At first I was reluctant to purchase this larger appliance that would be shipped through UPS for fear it would arrive damaged but UPS did a fine job with handling.  Rated it 3 stars as unit being average and appearance bearing clean lines which boosted my rating.",6/21/2004,0.21529406309127808,"['UPDATE', 'Yes', 'door', 'latch', 'button', 'melt', 'function', 'longer', 'actually', 'replaced', 'within', 'year', 'warranty', 'happened', 'second', 'time', 'boiling', 'water', 'front', 'burner', 'see', 'use', 'paying', 'second', 'repair', 'since', 'currently', 'using', 'pen', 'pop', 'door', 'open', 'course', 'replace', 'whole', 'microwave', 'near', 'future', 'soooo', 'happy', 'finally', 'ca', 'wait', 'ditch', 'appliance', 'waste', 'next', 'time', 'choosing', 'regular', 'handle', 'push', 'button', 'latch', 'Live', 'Learn', 'test', 'designs', 'practical', 'applications', 'releasing', 'consumer', 'buying', 'anything', 'sharp', 'company', 'time', 'soon', 'purchased', 'microwave', 'replace', 'countertop', 'model', 'emerson', 'proffesional', 'stainless', 'steel', 'needed', 'spacesaving', 'feature', 'plus', 'vent', 'stove', 'wanted', 'stainless', 'steel', 'match', 'stainless', 'steel', 'appliances', 'purchased', 'Amazon', 'lowest', 'price', 'could', 'find', 'currently', 'waiting', 'sharp', 'price', 'bad', 'deal', 'handle', 'makes', 'sleek', 'looking', 'control', 'panel', 'hidden', 'behind', 'door', 'used', 'set', 'controls', 'closing', 'door', 'makes', 'cleaning', 'easier', 'countertop', 'model', 'higher', 'quality', 'stainless', 'steel', 'paid', 'sides', 'front', 'like', 'model', 'installed', 'unit', 'vent', 'vertically', 'outside', 'damper', 'bit', 'flimsy', 'hopefully', 'tested', 'sharp', 'reliability', 'Exhaust', 'fan', 'unit', 'detects', 'heat', 'stove', 'automatically', 'operates', 'unit', 'bit', 'noisy', 'either', 'hi', 'low', 'setting', 'wish', 'light', 'hi', 'low', 'settings', 'either', 'bright', 'enough', 'night', 'light', 'feature', 'Overall', 'work', 'fine', 'looks', 'good', 'high', 'end', 'unit', 'high', 'end', 'price', 'nice', 'feature', 'senses', 'food', 'cooked', 'used', 'potatoes', 'turned', 'first', 'reluctant', 'purchase', 'larger', 'appliance', 'would', 'shipped', 'UPS', 'fear', 'would', 'arrive', 'damaged', 'UPS', 'fine', 'job', 'handling', 'Rated', 'stars', 'unit', 'average', 'appearance', 'bearing', 'clean', 'lines', 'boosted', 'rating']"

I've found that in the heat of the summer I can use this oven vs. my gas oven and it cooks faster and doesn't heat up the house as much.  There is also a function that combines microwave and convection cooking to get meals done even faster... there are so many things this machine does, I've yet to figure them all out.<br />A nice feature, you can turn the turntable on/off depending on whether you have a round or rectangular dish.<br />The unit runs on regular 110 voltage, so no complicated rewiring.<br />GE, Kenmore and Samsung all have similar units -all made in Korea, all for the same price or more. I chose this microwave because I was tired of complaining about outsourcing of American jobs and wanted to support a company like Sharp that is still making some of their units here in the USA.",6/19/2004,0.5,"['purchased', 'item', 'two', 'reasons', 'Union', 'Made', 'microwave', 'assembled', 'TN', 'American', 'made', 'microwave', 'found', 'convection', 'oven', 'double', 'br', 'styling', 'unit', 'nice', 'sleek', 'overcomplicated', 'enhances', 'look', 'br', 'microwave', 'cooking', 'simple', 'built', 'functions', 'thawing', 'frozen', 'items', 'popping', 'popcorn', 'etc', 'punch', 'button', 'asks', 'many', 'steaks', 'defrosting', 'much', 'popcorn', 'popping', 'br', 'Convection', 'cooking', 'new', 'manual', 'recipe', 'booklet', 'come', 'unit', 'already', 'produced', 'salmon', 'steaks', 'white', 'sauce', 'cooked', 'pizza', 'found', 'heat', 'summer', 'use', 'oven', 'gas', 'oven', 'cooks', 'faster', 'heat', 'house', 'much', 'also', 'function', 'combines', 'microwave', 'convection', 'cooking', 'get', 'meals', 'done', 'even', 'faster', 'many', 'things', 'machine', 'yet', 'figure', 'br', 'nice', 'feature', 'turn', 'turntable', 'depending', 'whether', 'round', 'rectangular', 'br', 'unit', 'runs', 'regular', 'voltage', 'complicated', 'br', 'GE', 'Kenmore', 'Samsung', 'similar', 'units', 'made', 'Korea', 'price', 'chose', 'microwave', 'tired', 'complaining', 'outsourcing', 'American', 'jobs', 'wanted', 'support', 'company', 'like', 'Sharp', 'still', 'making', 'units', 'USA']"
